Patient Name: [Redacted for Confidentiality]

Date of Birth: [Redacted for Confidentiality]

Date of Admission: [Date]

Date of Discharge: [Date]

Reason for Admission: The patient was admitted to our hospital with a variety of medical conditions and underwent several procedures. Upon review of the patient's chart, it is evident that they were diagnosed with multiple health issues, including:

* A history of hypertension (high blood pressure) and hyperlipidemia (elevated cholesterol levels), which led to the development of coronary artery disease.
* Chronic kidney disease, characterized by decreased renal function and elevated serum creatinine levels.
* Anemia, specifically a reduction in red blood cell count and hemoglobin levels.
* A history of chronic pain related to musculoskeletal disorders.
* Recent gastrointestinal issues, including inflammatory bowel disease.
* Cardiovascular disease, with evidence of myocardial infarction (heart attack) in the past.

During their hospital stay, the patient underwent several procedures, including:

* Angioplasty and stenting for coronary artery disease
* Dialysis to manage chronic kidney disease
* Blood transfusions to address anemia
* Physical therapy and pain management interventions for musculoskeletal disorders
* Endoscopy and bowel surgery to manage gastrointestinal issues

The patient has made significant progress during their hospital stay, and we are confident that they will continue to receive excellent care upon discharge. Our interdisciplinary team has worked closely with the patient to develop a comprehensive plan of care, addressing all aspects of their medical needs.

As the patient prepares to return home, we have provided them with necessary instructions and follow-up appointments to ensure continued management of their conditions. The patient is advised to:

* Adhere to their medication regimen as prescribed by their healthcare provider
* Attend regular follow-up appointments with their primary care physician and specialists
* Monitor their blood pressure and cholesterol levels closely
* Engage in regular physical activity and maintain a healthy diet

The patient's family members are also encouraged to support their loved one's recovery by providing emotional support, assisting with daily activities, and helping them adhere to their treatment plan.

Radiology
=========

___ CT A/P without contrast

IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Evaluation is limited secondary to lack of intravenous 
contrast.  Within 
that limitation the large pelvic mass appears slightly larger in 
comparison to 
the prior study.  There is suspected involvement of the 
posterior bladder wall 
and anterior margin of the rectosigmoid colon. 
2. Anasarca.  Interval development of mesenteric edema and small 
volume 
intra-abdominal ascites is suspicious for possible additional 
disease 
involvement. 
3. Destructive lytic lesion in the posterior right acetabulum is 
worsened from 
prior with a Right pelvic sidewall soft tissue component in 
continuity with 
the large pelvic mass. 
4. Persistent enlarged and abnormal endometrial cavity is 
slightly smaller 
from prior. 
5. There is unchanged severe right hydroureteronephrosis status 
post 
conversion of a right PCN to a PCNU which appears appropriately 
positioned.  
Moderate left hydroureteronephrosis appears slightly worsened 
from prior 
however this may be related to bladder distension. 
6. Bilateral obstructive hydrosalpinges as above. 
7. Retroperitoneal and pelvic lymphadenopathy as described 
above. 
8. Please refer to separate report of CT chest performed on the 
same day for 
description of the thoracic findings. 
  
NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, 
M.D. by 
___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:18 
am, 5 minutes 
after discovery of the findings. 

___ CT chest without contrast

1. Limited study secondary to significant respiratory motion 
artifact. 
2. Mixed interval response of the patient's known pulmonary 
metastatic 
lesions.  A lesion in the left upper lobe has decreased in size 
however a 
lesion in the posterior segment left lower lobe is larger from 
prior.  
Additional lesions appear grossly stable on limited assessment. 
3. Interval increase in size of two left axillary lymph nodes 
measuring up to 9 mm, previously 5 mm. 
4. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Anasarca. 
5. Bibasilar atelectasis with associated hypoventilatory 
changes. 
6. Findings compatible with anemia. 
7. Please refer to the separately dictated CT abdomen and pelvis 
for full 
description of the sub diaphragmatic findings. 

___ urinary cath replacement 
 
FINDINGS: 

1. Right antegrade nephrostogram shows distal ureteral 
obstruction. 
2. Appropriate final position of Right 8 ___ by 26 cm tube.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Goals of care 
After discovering more progression of disease on staging CT 
scan, outpatient team spoke with patient and family and decided 
to pursue hospice care, as no further treatement options 
avialble. Patient was also confirmed DNR/DNI and MOLST filled 
out. 

# ___ - IMPROVED
# Hydronephrosis
Presented with ___ with severe hydro on US. Suspect this is 
related to the clamped PCN after conversion to a PCNU on ___ by ___ and possible disease progression given more hydro on 
left, as well as hypovolemia from vomiting. Improved with fluid 
and uncapping PCNU. Had PCNU exchange ___, re-capped ___. Cr 
improved to 1.6, likely new baseline iso irreversible damage 
from severe hydro. 

#UTI
UA from PCNU bag was positive for infection, started on CTX, 
grew out E coli sensitive to CTX. Treating as complicated UTI 
with total 10 days abx, transitioned to cefpodoxime to finish 
10d course. (___). 

#N/V
Chronic issue, controlled with Zofran/Compazine PRN. Started on 
olanzapine 2.5mg QHS with improvement in sleep and morning 
nausea. 

# Stage IVb (metastatic) Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma -
PROGRESSSION. 
Non-con CT scan this admission with evidence of disease 
progression. Discussion with primary team as above. Continued on 
home pain regimen. Added zyprexa at night for nausea. Goals of 
care discussed, as above, with transition to DNR/DNI and MOLST 
form filled out.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service for 
recurrent prosthetic joint infection.  Joint aspiration showed 
coag negative staph.  He was started on IV antibiotics - 
Vancomycin.  Infectious disease was consulted for co-management. 
 The patient was taken to the operating room for a resection 
arthroplasty and placement of antibiotic spacer.  Please see 
separately dictated operative report for details. The surgery 
was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  
He resumed Vancomycin post-operatively.  Postoperative course 
was remarkable for 
the following: 

On POD#1, the patient triggered for sudden atrial fibrillation 
with RVR.  He was given 5 mg of Lopressor IV x 2 with adequate 
response.  He was also given a 1 liter bolus of fluid.  Two days 
later, he again had atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Lopressor was 
given x3.  Cardiology was consulted and recommended giving 
Diltiazem 10 mg.  That morning, his heart rate was sustained 
into the 150s (atrial fibrillation w/RVR).  He was again given 
Lopressor 5 mg x 3 and Diltiazem 5 mg x 1.  He was then started 
on oral Metoprolol 12.5 mg every 6 hours based on Cardiology 
recommendations.  A PICC line was placed for long-term 
antibiotic management on ___.  On POD#2, his drains were 
discontinued.  On POD#3, his hematocrit was 22 and he was given 
2 units of blood.  His post-transfusion hematocrit was stable at 
25.2. Infectious disease recommended qh8 IV vancomycin 1250mg 
and troughs were checked before every 4th dose with a goal 
trough between 15 and 20.  On POD#4 cardiology recommended a 
trans thoracic echocardiogram which indicated an EF of 55%.  
Standing Toprol extended release 75mg was recommended for 
paroxysmal afib. On POD#6 his INR was 1.2 and 5mg of Coumadin 
was given. On POD#7 Mr. ___ INR was 1.2 and his  
Coumadin and lovenox were discontinued per cardiology 
recommendations. He was started on BID 5mg of apixaban.  
Infectious disease recommended changing antibiotic therapy to 
daptomycin 650mg q24h for a likely ___ dose was 
given prior to discharge without any reaction.   

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#2 that was 
discontinued on POD#7.  The foley was removed and the patient 
was voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was 
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean 
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient 
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout 
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is non weight bearing on the 
operative extremity in full extension in knee brace at all 
times.  

Mr. ___ is discharged to home with services in stable 
condition.

IMAGING
=====================
CXR ___:
FINDINGS: 
Dual lead left-sided pacer device is stable in position.  
Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable as compared to ___.  Re-demonstrated is calcification of the apical 
septal mild cardia M. no new focal consolidation is seen.  No 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No pulmonary edema is 
seen.
IMPRESSION:
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
.
TTE ___:
Conclusions
--Extremely limited image quality. The left ventricle is not 
well seen. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
severely depressed. The right ventricular free wall is 
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with 
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve is not 
well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no 
pericardial effusion.
--Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
left ventricular contractile function appears depressed, but the 
technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes 
definitve comparison. 
.
.
Cardiac Catheterization ___:
Coronary Anatomy
Dominance: Right
-LMCA: The native LAD and CX were known to be occluded 
proximally, so the LMCA was not imaged.
-RCA: The native RCA was known occluded proximally and was not 
imaged.
-SVG-OM: The ostial SVG stent was patent. There was mild 
plaquing in the proximal SVG. The mid SVG between 2 clips had a 
hazy 40-50% stenosis overlying a ___ clip with a linear flap 
consistent with an ulcerated and possibly dissected plaque 
(likely at a prior venous valve). There was a smooth 40-50% 
stenosis distally proximal to patent recent stent in the distal 
SVG. Flow was TIMI 2 pulsatile in the SVG.
-SVG-RPDA-RPL2: There was a smooth 50% stenosis in the proximal 
SVG. The mid SVG had diffuse mild plaquing. The SVG anastomosed 
onto the lower pole of the RPDA with antegrade perfusion only 
(the lower pole RPDA was occluded retrogradely at the 
anastomosis). The recently stented portion of the large RPL2 was 
patent. There was an eccentric 50-60% stenosis at the origin of 
the RPL2. The RPL2 supplied antegrade flow to a diffusely 
diseased RPL3 with serial 70% stenoses and poor distal runoff. 
The RPL2 supplied retrograde flow into a diseased native RCA 
which supplied a modest caliber modest caliber RPL1 branch and 
the severely diseased upper/distal pole of the RPDA (with total 
occlusion of the grafted earlier/lower pole at its origin). 
There was also antegrade flow from the SVG into the distal 
grafted RPL2.
-___: The LIMA had been documented to be patent 2 
procedures ago and was not imaged today.
Interventional Details
-The findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ 
Dr. ___. Decision ultimately made to stent the ulcerated 
lesion in the mid SVG-OM and defer PCI of the origin of the RPL2 
(which did not seem severe enough to cause rest pain). There was 
clearly extensive severe small vessel native CAD
not amenable to PCI.
-Change for a 6 ___ AL-1 guiding catheter with provided 
adequate support. Additional heparin was given to achieve a 
therapeutic ACT. An 180 cm Sion Blue wire was delivered into the 
native OM over which a 3.0 mm Spider FX embolic protection 
device was exchanged. The mid SVG-OM lesion was directly stented 
using a 3.5x16 mm RX Promus Premier drug-eluting stent deployed 
at 11 atm. Final angiography after IG nicardipine showed a 5% 
residual stenosis, no apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow, with 
unchanged disease in the proximal and distal SVG. The patient 
reported no chest discomfort during balloon inflation, but did 
have some bilateral arm discomfort that may have been 
positional. A TR Band was applied to the LRA with good 
hemostasis. An additional dose of clopidogrel 300 mg was 
administered at the conclusion of the case. The patient left the 
cardiac catheterization laboratory pain free and in stable 
condition. Angiograms were reviewed with Dr. ___.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old man with CAD S/P CABG with known occlusions of the 
proximal LAD, LCX and RCA, S/P multiple PCIs, most recently 
___ (drug-eluting stent to ostial SVG-OM and another 
drug-eluting stent at the distal anastomosis, drug-eluting stent 
in the RPDA approached retrogradely
through the SVG-RPDA), S/P ICD for primary prevention (EF 20%) 
who returns with ongoing rest pain.
.
## CHEST PAIN:
Absence of ST elevation on EKG and minimal troponin elevation 
were not consistent with in-stent thrombosis. Team considered it 
most likely patient's symptoms were either related to small 
vessel disease or narrowing in areas that had not been subject 
to intervention previously, or, less likely, that he had a stent 
complication such as dissection.
.
Initial troponin was mildly elevated (0.09) from troponin 2 days 
prior (0.07). He was pain free on arrival to floor and nitro gtt 
was stopped, while heparin gtt was continued. Home medications 
including ___ 81, metoprolol, rosuvastatin, and 
pantoprazole were continued. Home lisinopril was held in 
anticipation of possible contrast load with cardiac 
catheterization. He remained pain free until reporting some mild 
CP overnight HD1, which resolved with SL nitro x 2. His EKG at 
the time was unchanged. Troponin increased to 0.1 morning of HD 
2. Nitroglycerin gtt was restarted. He was maintained on heparin 
and nitro gtt HD2 without symptoms with plan for cath HD 3 until 
he again had chest tightness and epigastric discomfort 
overnight. Troponins were cycling and remained stably elevated 
at 0.09->0.1->0.09->0.1.
.
Morning of HD3 he was taken urgently to cath lab for evaluation 
and was was found to have ulcerated lesion of mid SVG-OM. ___ 
1 was placed to SVG-OM with subsequent TIMI 3 flow. Lesion with 
50-60% stenosis of origin of the RPL2 was noted but did not seem 
severe enough to cause rest pain, so stent was deferred. There 
was clearly also extensive severe small vessel native CAD not 
amenable to PCI. Patient was chest pain free after stent 
placement. Ambulating without difficulty or discomfort prior to 
discharge and cleared by physical therapy. 
.
## HFrEF: Previously with depressed EF 20%, which was impetutus 
for ICD placement.  Patient's most recent echo with EF 19%. Home 
furosemide was held ___ but restarted prior to discharge 
and he remained euvolemic. Home metoprolol XL 100mg was 
fractionated to tartrate 25mg Q6H for admission.
.
## HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Continued home rosuvastatin, dose limited by 
history of myalgias.
.
# HTN: Home lisinopril held ___, restarted prior to 
discharge.
.
=======================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=======================
--Patient was already on ___ need to continue ___ 
for ___ year as previously planned
--Home dose of rosuvastatin was not increased because of 
patient's history of myalgias with higher statin doses
- Chest pain free post cath
- No changes made to home medications
- Needs to follow-up with PCP and cardiology as scheduled

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY STATEMENT
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old-male with DM2, HTN, ESRD on HD, 
CAD, and PVD with multiple recent hospital admissions who 
presents with fevers, cough, and hemoptysis diagnosed with 
influenza and pneumonia. 

ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
# Fever
# Multifocal pneumonia: Patient presented with fevers, cough, 
hemoptysis and weakness.  Testing revealed that he was flu 
positive, CXR demonstrating multifocal pneumonia concerning for 
bacterial superinfection. Given multiple recent hospital 
admissions and history of pseudomonas on ___, broad 
coverage was initiated. Patient was treated with vancomycin, 
cefepime, and levofloxacin (treated with one dose of 
azithromycin) for empiric MRSA and double pseudomonas coverage. 
This was narrowed to levofloxacin after MRSA swab negative and 
sputum culture showed commensal respiratory organisms for a 
total of 7 days. Symptoms managed with albuterol PRN, tessalon 
perls, ipratropium inhalers, NaCl nasal spray for dry nostrils, 
and Afrin for nose bleeds. Blood culture and urine culture were 
negative.

# Influenza B: Tested positive. He was treated with oseltamivir 
30 mg after every HD session for 5 days (___).

# Hypertension: His blood pressure was elevated to SBP 200s in 
the ED, during which he felt asymptomatic. During prior 
hospitalizations, he has had many SBPs in 180s-190s and has a 
history of difficult to control hypertension. Of note, there is 
prior documentation that he is non-compliant with his 
medications but also a recent hospitalization for hypotension in 
___. Patient was continued on home carvedilol, imdur, 
clonidine, nifedipine, and doxazosin. Hydralazine was 
discontinued and lisinopril 20 mg PO QD (per renal) was added. 
While inpatient, the patient's blood pressure ranged 110s/60s to 
200s/90s while inpatient, but seemed to be better controlled on 
this new regimen. 

# DM2: Patient was treated with 12u lantus QPM and sliding 
scale.

# Neuropathy: Patient reported feelings of cold feet since 
initiation of dialysis in ___. He was currently on 
gabapentin 100 mg, but this may have been washed out in HD so 
dose was changed to ___ dosing after HD.

# ESRD on HD
He is on HD ___ via LUE AVG, which was placed on ___. LUE 
AVG was used at HD successfully for 3 HD sessions here. 
Transplant and renal team approved LUE AVG as main HD access 
with approval of removal of tunneled R IJ line.  His line was 
not able to be removed on this hospitalization.  During his 
hospital admission, he was on a renal diet, fluid restrictions, 
nephrocaps, and home vitamin D.

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# Anemia: His Hgb on admission was 11.3 which is at baseline. We 
recommend treatment with IV iron per above as outpatient. 

# CAD: He was diagnosed with NSTEMI in ___, at which time 
catherization showed 2v disease that was non-intervenable. 
During his hospital admission, he was continued on ASA, Plavix, 
atorvastatin, antihypertensives per above.

# PVD: He was continued on ASA and Plavix.

# Other home medications: 
He was continued on Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q6H:PRN, 
OxyCODONE 5 mg PO Q4H:PRN, and Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
======================
[]Pneumonia:  Last day of levofloxacin: ___.
[]Neuropathy:  If gabapentin not effective, could consider a 
trial of amitriptyline
[]Question of Restless Leg Syndrome:  Pt's ""cold legs"" could 
possibly be manifestations of Restless leg, although we felt 
less likely.  If neuropathic treatment not effective, consider 
iron deficiency work-up and repletion as this may help his 
symptoms""
[] Blood pressure: follow up blood pressure and adjust 
medications as needed.
[] R IJ line:  We attempted to remove on day of discharge, but 
unable to given scheduling limitations.  Per renal, ok to 
discontinue tunneled R IJ line as AVG well functioning. 
Interventional radiology should schedule follow up. If no 
follow-up arranged within 5 days, please call @ ___
[] Discharge insulin: 12 u bedtime glargine. Increase glargine 
as needed.
[ ]Hypertension: Given patient HD, renal suggested starting 
lisinopril for blood pressure control.  Recommend attempt to 
simplify blood pressure regimen to once or twice daily 
medications.  Hydralazine discontinued. Could consider clonidine 
patch for simplified therapy.  Would increase nifedipine if 
needed instead of adding additional agents.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a Laparoscopic Right 
Colectomy for surgical management of your Ascending Colon 
Cancer. You have recovered from this procedure well and you are 
now ready to return home. Samples from your colon were taken and 
this tissue has been sent to the pathology department for 
analysis. You will receive these pathology results at your

bilaterally and retrocrural lymphadenopathy.  The evaluation of
the upper abdomen is limited on this examination however there 
is
concern for additional lymphadenopathy in the upper abdomen. 
Findings raise the possibility of lymphoma.  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV 
contrast
for evaluation of abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy and potentially
to determine biopsy target 

XR foot (___):
FINDINGS:  
The indication does not provide information as to which toe is 
of
concern.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic.  There is no acute
fracture or dislocation.  There are degenerative changes present
around the distal interphalangeal joints, first interphalangeal
joint as well as the second and third proximal interphalangeal
joints.  There is no erosions or abnormal periosteal reaction
identified.  There are no significant degenerative changes. 
Vascular calcification is present. 
IMPRESSION:  
No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.  Further evaluation
with an MRI or bone scan is recommended. 

CT abd/pelvis with contrast (___):
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive retrocrural, mesenteric, retroperitoneal and 
bilateral pelvic lymphadenopathy, likely representing lymphoma.
2. Left adrenal mass and mesenteric soft tissue mass, also 
likely lymphoma.
3. Extensive bilateral perirenal soft tissue density in keeping 
with lymphomatous involvement.
4. Possible biopsy targets include retroperitoneal nodes (likely 
preferred if complete lymphoma protocol is planned) and 
perirenal soft tissue.
5. Extrahepatic biliary and main pancreatic duct dilation is of 
uncertain etiology, but a focal obstructing lesion is not 
identified on this study.  This could be followed up with MRCP 
if felt clinically indicated.

___ -- IMPRESSION: Successful CT guided core biopsy of a 
target left retroperitoneal lymph node. Samples were sent for 
pathology, flow cytometry and cytogenetics.

___ CytogeneticsTissue: BLOOD, NEOPLASTIC -- PENDING

hemiplegia, peripheral vascular disease, h/o prostate cancer and 
multiple myeloma with prior report of lymphadenopathy, and h/o 
DVT/PE who was recently treated for PNA at his SNF with a 5-day 
course of levofloxacin.  He presented with lethargy and fevers 
and was found to be septic most likely ___ HCAP, hypernatremia, 
and with diffuse lymphadenopathy on CTA chest and abdomen/pelvis

-Patient has received most of his hematology/oncology care at 
___
-He was transferred to ___ this time instead of there at the 
request of a family member (not ___ the proxy, another 
different family member)
-CTA CHEST incidentally showed diffuse lympadenopathy (right 
cervical, left axillary, mediastinal, internal mammary 
bilaterally and retrocrural).  CT abdomen pelvis also revealed 
extensive lymphadenopathy and soft tissue masses in his abdomen. 
This was concerning for lymphoma, especially in the setting of 
failure to thrive. Uric acid was elevated but other TLS labs 
have been normal.
-Allopurinol ___ mg daily (renally dosed) was started for 
hyperuricemia
-After discussion with the on-call hematologist oncologist at

much more significant and had not been previously observed
-We sent peripheral blood for flow, serum light chains (free 
kappa/lambda), SPEP, UPEP, quantitative immunoglobulins, beta-2 
microglobulin -- Hematology/Oncology interpreted findings have 
all been consistent with the patient's known multiple myeloma

retroperitoneal lymph node conglomerate on ___ 
-- prelim pathology was consistent with prior biopsy findings 
per ___ hematology/oncology fellow, who spoke by phone with 
the ___ Hematologist-Oncologist, Dr. ___, 
___
-No further workup or specific treatment at this time, the 
patient will follow up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient

#Failure to thrive
#Anorexia
#Severe protein calorie malnutrition
#Dysphagia
#Hypophosphatemia
#Hyponatremia
-His daughter reported that he has had very little PO intake for 
a few months at least.  His dysphagia, and depression may be 
contributing.
-Started thiamine on ___ (IV given he cannot take oral)
-SLP evaluation recommended NPO given the patient's high risk of 
aspiration and they felt that his prognosis for improvement was 
quite limited, and they felt that a G-tube was appropriate, even 
without trying a small bore nasogastric feeding tube ___
The patient and his daughter (proxy) spoke about this issue 
several times and he made an informed decision to proceed with 
placement of the G-tube
-Interventional radiology placed a G-tube on ___
-Tube feeds started on ___ and he has been on Jevity 1.5 at 50 
cc/hr (goal) without problems
-Nutrition followed and he was monitored for refeeding syndrome
-He has required intermittent magnesium and phosphate repletion

#Left leg swelling

-Suspect mild volume overload from maintenance IV fluids while 
NPO as well as hypoalbuminemia secondary to malnutrition

# Hyponatremia: Improved to 134 by discharge.
-Decreased free water flushes for tube feeds to 50cc Q6H with 
improvement

#Sacral decubitus stage II ulcer (present on admission)
#Penile skin tear from condom catheter: Per RN notes, ""mepilex 
to coccyx... scrotum excoriated, barrier cream applied. skin 
tear on underside of base of penis, barrier cream applied""
- Wound care was following 
- Foley was placed to help promote wound healing in setting of 
urinary incontinence, but should be removed as soon as feasible 
(from wound healing standpoint) to avoid UTI

#Sinus tachycardia: Mild, HR in ___ to low 100s

#Megaloblastic anemia: Stable
-B12 high/normal, suspect related to the patient's known bone 
marrow process, referred to outpatient hematologist/oncologist 
regarding the need for any further workup

#Mild coagulopathy: INR elevated
-Improved after vitamin K 2.5mg IV on ___

#Diarrhea
#H/o Clostridium difficile infection
-C. diff was negative
-Unclear what his loose stools are from, but his benign 
abdominal exam, normal white count, and lack of fever were all 
reassuring

#L MCA CVA ___ with residual R hemiplegia and aphasia
#Peripheral vascular disease with L ___ toe non-healing ulcer
-In ___ he had an angiogram of the left lower extremity to 
eval for possible revascularization in light of his non-healing 
left ___ toe ulcer. This was revealing for 50% stenosis of the 
popliteal artery (non-hemodynamically significant) and chronic 
occlusion of the left posterior tibial artery with some ""spidery 
reconstitution"" at the level of the ankle, and a diminutive 
anterior tibial artery. There was no hemodynamically significant 
lesion discovered to intervene upon. XR left foot to eval for 
underlying osteomyelitis was negative for evidence of osteo
-Wound care was following
-He is not on ASA or other secondary stroke prevention but he is 
on full dose anticoagulation

#Hypertension
-Home Diltiazem was held in the setting of sepsis and was not 
restarted since SBP was in ___

#Recurrent prior DVTs, with IVC filter (per ___ note)
#Possible prior arterial clotting
-Unsure if IVC filter is still in place, but presume it is
-He was not on any therapeutic anticoagulation at his skilled 
nursing facility, but we learned that he should have been on 
full dose enoxaparin, so this was started on ___.  The 
enoxaparin was briefly held ___, and was then 
restarted ___ evening.

#Resolved sepsis ___ HCAP with ongoing aspiration risk
-On admission, he was empirically started on meropenem, 
vancomycin, and azithromycin given his recent exposure to 
levofloxacin and risk for multidrug resistant organisms. 
However, these were stopped soon after admission due to lack of 
localizing evidence of infection. On ___, he became febrile, 
tachycardic, and tachypneic with a neutrophilic-predominant 
leukocytosis. CTA chest was performed which showed bibasilar 
consolidations consistent with pneumonia. Foot XR was negative 
for osteomyelitis underlying his chronic non-healing left ___ 
toe ulcer. UA was taken after the patient had received a dose of 
meropenem but there was no growth in the culture.
-Given negative MRSA screen, his vancomycin was stopped
-In addition given his stability/improvement and lack of any 
concerning culture results, he received 7 days of 
piperacillin-tazobactam (finished ___

#Incidental finding on CT A/P: ""Extrahepatic biliary and main 
pancreatic duct dilation is of uncertain etiology, but a focal 
obstructing lesion is not identified on this study. This could 
be followed up with MRCP if felt clinically indicated.""

#History of asthma
-Ipratropium-albuterol nebs as needed

#Concern for encephalopathy: Difficult to assess his mental 
status given aphasia. Per daughter he has had some memory 
problems since his stroke, but she has not felt he has been 
confused. On ___ in the evening he started to become slightly
agitated (taking oxygen off). SpO2 90-92% on room air. 
Redirectable and answering most questions appropriately. No 
obvious etiology for encephalopathy, although he has not had any 
head imaging during this admission. Given the concern for 
lymphoma it would be reasonable to get a CT head should he have 
any change in mental status or in his level of alertness -- 
acknowledging it could be difficult to interpret a CT of the 
head given his prior stroke. He was alert, answers questions 
with head
nods, and still difficult to assess for confusion but he has not 
been agitated or drowsy for days prior to discharge.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for a change in mental status 
and fevers. You were found to have pneumonia and you were 
treated with antibiotics.  We also found that your swallowing 
function was no longer safe and that you were at risk of 
aspiration.  It is likely that aspiration led to the pneumonia 
that prompted your admission.

As a result of your problems swallowing, we also found that your 
nutritional status was not good, so after much discussion with 
you and your daughter, we placed a gastric feeding tube 
(G-tube), and started tube feeds.  This will allow you to get 
nutrition, hydration, and medications through the tube.  You 
will continue the tube feeds when you leave the hospital.

You were also found to have many enlarged lymph nodes throughout 
your body.  A biopsy was performed that showed that the enlarged 
lymph nodes were likely because of your known multiple myeloma.  
We recommend that you follow-up with your 
hematologist/oncologist at ___.

You were also treated for a sacral ulcer and our nurses have 
been changing the dressing to help keep this area clean and dry. 
 We also placed a urinary catheter temporarily to help keep the 
wound clean and dry as much as possible.  As the wound heals, 
the catheter will need to be removed, as it can be an infection 
risk the longer it stays in place.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ G2P1, who arrived
to Labor and Delivery in active labor.  She was found to be 4
to 5 cm dilated and received an epidural.  She ruptured
membranes spontaneously and was unchanged over two exams, and
received pitocin to augment her labor.  She
progressed to fully dilated and pushed in the second stage of
labor for over three hours with minimal descent of the fetal
vertex. She developed chorioamnionitis with fetal tachycardia 
and a fever during
labor and was started on antibiotics for chorioamnionitis. 
Given arrest of descent in the second stage of labor, the
a repeat cesarean section was recommended and performed.
 Her post operative course and delivery was complicated by post 
partum hemorrhage.

Regarding her postpartum hemorrhage, estimated blood loss was 
1000cc.  Pre-operatively her hematocrit was 33.1 and on POD #1 
her hematocrit was 22.7. She was thus transfused 2 units of 
packed red blood cells, with a post transfusion, was 27.4. On 
POD #2, patient noted to be tachycardic with a heart rate in the 
low 100s. Her hct was repeated and was found to 21.5. She thus 
received another transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood 
cells, with a followup hematocrit of 24.3. Patient was 
asymptomatic and vital signs were stable. 

Regarding her chorioamnionitis, patient was placed on 
ampicillin, gentamicin, clindamycin for 24 hours post partum and 
remained afebrile, with anormal post operative exam.  

Post operatively, her pain was treated with oral pain 
medications. She ambulated and her foley was discontinued and 
she voided spontaneously, with no complications. Her diet was 
advanced without incident. By postpartum day 4, she was 
tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently, and pain 
was controlled with oral medications. She was afebrile with 
stable vital signs. She was then discharged home in stable 
condition with postpartum outpatient follow-up scheduled.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the neurosurgical service for 
elective surgery. He underwent a left fronto-pareital craniotomy 
for implantation of invasive epilepsy monitoring electrodes. For 
more information on the surgery please refer to the operative 
report. The procedure was well tolerated. He was extubated in 
the OR and transferred to the ICU. Postoperatively, he was noted 
to have expressive aphasia, but was able to follow commands and 
had a slight right facial asymmetry. He moved all extremities 
against gravity, but he preferred the left side to the right. He 
underwent an MRI to confirm lead placement. 

On ___, the patient continued to be aphasic, with more 
difficulty following commands. He continued to have a slight 
right facial asymmetry. NCHCT was obtained which was stable. He 
was treated with a tapering course of IV dexamethasone from 
___ over which time his aphasia improved; he was able to 
spontaneously produce 7 or more words in a sentence and follow 
complex two- and three-step commands, and had intact repetition 
and naming. He also used his RUE and RLE symmetrically with full 
strength on manual motor testing. He was maintained on ancef 
while the electrodes were in place. Due to the aphasia and 
concern for post-operative swelling, he was put on a 
dexamethasone taper on ___ he was decreased by 2mg ever 24 
hours from 10mg. This was discontinued on ___. He had 
leukocytosis on ___ to 14.3; there was concern he had a fever 
but review of nursing documentation reveals no evidence of 
fever. Evaluation for a source of infection was unrevealing; 
given his neurologic examination remained stably improving and 
he remained afebrile, there was low suspicion for surgical wound 
infection or meningitis/encephalitis. The leukocytosis remained 
present until ___ after which it spontaneously resolved, and 
did not recur. The leukocytosis was felt possible a delayed 
reaction to the steroid course.

He was transferred to the neurology service for EEG monitoring. 
His Depakote was weaned off; it was discontinued on ___. His 
lyrica was also weaned off and discontinued on ___. He 
underwent EEG monitoring, and the evidence of cortical 
irritability seen postoperatively improved. He had an 
electrographic seizure without clinical correlate on ___ and 
had an electroclinical seizure on ___ during cortical language 
mapping. Mapping was attempted again ___ but complicated by 
increased EEG activity during stimulation requiring Ativan. He 
was reloaded on his AEDs on ___ and underwent language 
mapping ___. This was successful and showed that speech 
fluency was retained however stimulation of anterior temporal 
pole did lead to an anomia. He was offered the option of 
anterior temporal resection. He went to OR on ___ for depth 
electrode removal and resection. Surgery was uncomplicated and 
he was extubated in the OR. Postoperatively, he was transferred 
to the Neurosurgery service from the Neuromed service.

___: OR today. NRB for pneumo. Lytes checked for bigeminy in 
PACU. Mg repleted. 

___: In PACU patient alert and oriented x 3 with choices. 
Dressing intact. Per ___  okay to transfer to floor and 
mobilize.

subgaleal collection, but otherwise unchanged, per epilepsy 
please add lfts/Depakote, T 102.8 at 1500, pan culture neurology 
attending feels ID should see the patient and start antibiotics. 
CONSULTED ID ___ prelim reccs: aspiration PNA given seizure 
disorder vs CNS infection start vanc/zosyn, LP if not 
contraindicated- they will see formally on ___, neurology c/s 
to assess pt, dressing taken down - incision c/d/I, fluid 
collection under skin.

Keppra. LP done at bedside. At neurology request, MRI brain 
repeated. Upper extremity ultrasounds not done day prior, repeat 
request sent. Infiltrate of Vanco to LUE.

On ___, the patient remained lethargic but had a mildly 
improving exam.  His LP CSF culture was so far negative, as was 
his blood cultures.  He continued to be febrile to 101.8, 
however, his white count was normal.  MRI showed expected 
post-operative changes. Overnight into ___ he was noted to be 
febrile to 102.8 axillary.

On ___ am rounds the patient was much brighter and afebrile. He 
was oriented x 3, moving all extremities with excellent 
strength, although still slightly lethargic. His vancomycin was 
changed to 1.25grams q12h, his depakote level was therapeutic, 
and tylenol was held to assist in monitoring his fever curve. 

On ___ he remained neurologically intact with some consistent 
lethargy. He remained afebrile and his depakote level was 
therapeutic. 

On ___ the patients neurological exam was much improved and he 
was very bright on morning exam. The patient was neurologically 
intact and was not having speech difficulty on exam. The 
patients staples remained clean dry and intact. The patient was 
re-started on Vancomycin and Ceftaz per Epilepsy request for 
preventative CNS coverage for a total of 14 days. He was 
consented for a PICC line in preparation for discharge to rehab. 


On ___, the patient remained stable.  He had a PICC line placed 
for his continued Vancomycin.  He should have a Vancomycin 
trough tomorrow morning.  He will continue on Pregabalin and 
Depakote ER.  He should have a Depakote trough tomorrow morning 
as well.  He will follow up with Dr. ___ week for staples 
removal.  He will follow up with Dr. ___ he ___

mildly dilated. There is no evidence for an aortic arch 
coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is 
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are elongated with mild bileaflet systolic prolapse. There is 
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve
leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid
regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular wall thickness and 
biventricular cavity sizes and regional/
global systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Right ventricular cavity
dilation. Posterior mitral leaflet elongation with mild 
bileaflet systolic prolapse, but no pathologic
regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aora.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with HCV/EtOH 
cirrhosis (decompensated by ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, 
esophageal varices), severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic left
main PA thrombus on Coumadin, opiate use disorder on methadone 
and active smoking who presents as a transfer from ___ 
___ with dyspnea and hypoxia thought to be secondary to 
COPD exacerbation triggered by possible viral URI. 
  
ACUTE ISSUES  
===============  
#Hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
PFTs in ___ showed moderately severe obstructive 
ventilatory defect, a severe decrease in exercise capacity, and 
a gas exchange defect and/or hypoventilation. Given this poor 
reserve,
she is high risk for respiratory failure.  Presented with acute 
shortness of breath and need for non-rebreather in the ED, 
quickly weaned to 4 L NC once admitted to the MICU.  BNP >17k 
and never previously higher than 3k, but CXR showed 
hyperinflated lungs without significant pulmonary edema and she 
is not total body volume overloaded. No evidence of pneumonia. 
Possibly consistent with viral respiratory infection or COPD 
exacerbation. PE much less likely given supratherapeutic INR.  
Continued on prednisone 40mg + azithromycin for 5 days total. 
Oxygen was unable to be weaned initially so pulmonary was 
consulted who recommended increasing torsemide to 20 mg PO BID 
for short term increased diuresis. TTE showed improved pressures 
from prior. Her oxygen saturations were adequate on discharge so 
she did not need to be discharged with home O2.

___ on CKD.
CKD attributed to NSAID use and cardiorenal syndrome along with 
possible chronic interstitial process. Recent baseline 1.9-2.1. 
Presented with Cr 2.3 and BUN elevated above normal. Given
self-reported anorexia for several days and dry mucous 
membranes, likely pre-renal. Encouraged oral hydration as high 
risk of overloading right heart with IV fluids. Cr returned to 
baseline by hospital day 2. 

#Hypomagnesemia
Repleted in ED. Resolved. 

CHRONIC ISSUES  
===============  
#Pulmonary Hypertension
Last seen in pulmonary ___ clinic in ___ 
showed RA 17, PA 89/43 (60), PCWP 35. Previously charted as 
having right heart failure but only has mild RV dilation on TTE. 
Right heart
cath suggests both pre-capillary and post-capillary components. 
Has COPD, chronic thromboembolic disease, possible 
hepatopulmonary syndrome given positive late bubbles.
- Continued home Sildenafil 40mg TID
- Continued home Macitentan (opsumit) 10mg daily

#Chronic left main PA thrombus
On warfarin. INR supratherapeutic to 5.0 on presentation. 
Downtrended throughout admission. Warfarin held for paracentesis 
on ___. Restarted on ___.

#EtOH and HCV cirrhosis
Previously decompensated by ascites, HE, esophageal varices. On 
furosemide/spironolactone at home. LFTs not recently elevated. 
No evidence of hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy. Abdomen 
became more distended during stay and ___ performed paracentesis 
with only removal of 20 mL as the pocket was not large enough.
- Continued home epclusa 
- Continued home rifaximin 

#Thrombocytopenia
Likely secondary to cirrhosis. 
- Stable on daily CBC
- Warfarin as above

#H/o opiate use disorder 
No record of opiate prescriptions in MassPMP. Methadone 50mg 
from ___. Confirmed dose with ___. 
- Continued home methadone 50mg daily 

#Smoking
- Nicotine patch while in house 
- Tried to discuss resources to quit but patient did not want to 
discuss

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- follow up creatinine at discharge
- adjust torsemide dose based on weight/volume status
- needs follow up with pulmonary hypertension clinic

>30 minutes spent on complex discharge

325mg and was started on atorvastatin at the outside hospital. 
We continued the atorvastatin and his home ASA 81mg/day. He 
started metoprolol tartrate titrated up to 12.5mg QID, and 
started a heparin gtt leading up to CABG given that the patient 
had a brief recurrence of CP.  
He was taken to the operating room on ___. He underwent 
coronary artery bypass grafting x4. Please see operative note 
for full details. In summary he had:
1.  Coronary artery bypass graft x 4.  Total arterial 
revascularization.
2.  Skeletonized left internal mammary artery sequential 
grafting to the diagonal and the left anterior descending 
artery.
3.  Skeletonized free right internal mammary artery as a T graft 
off the left internal mammary artery to the distal circumflex.
4.  Left radial artery grafting to posterior descending artery.
5.  Endoscopic harvesting of the left radial artery.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU 
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. He 
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was 
extubated on the day of surgery. He was weaned from intravenous 
medications, Beta blocker and nitrates were initiated and he was 
diuresed toward his preoperative weight. He remained 
hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the telemetry 
floor for further recovery. Beta blockers were titrated up with 
HR >100 for several days. He was transitioned from nitroglycerin 
to Imdur for radial artery graft, and should continue this for 3 
months postop. ACE-I was started with preop NSTEMI. He was 
restarted on his home oral diabetic medications and Lantus for 
hyperglycemia. Chest tubes remained in an additional day due to 
high serous drainage. Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed 
per cardiac surgery protocol without complication. He was 
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with 
strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 4 he was 
ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing, and pain was 
controlled with oral analgesics. He was discharged to ___ at 
___ in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.   Prevena should be removed on POD 7 (___).

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

His postoperative course was significant for: 
On POD#1, the patient was unable to void and was straight 
cath'ed x1.  He was able to void independently thereafter.  On 
POD#3, the patient had a change in mental status.  His narcotics 
were decreased and Gabapentin was discontinued as well as Flomax 
due to his periods of incontinence.  Labs were checked and his 
creatinine was 2.5.  He was given a bolus of fluid (1-liter).  A 
fever ___ was also performed.  An infectious source was not 
identified.  On POD#4, he was given one unit of blood for a 
hematocrit of 24.4.  Labs were rechecked and showed ***.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with an intrascalene 
block followed by a transition to oral pain medications on 
POD#1.  The patient received Coumadin while in house for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on POD#0, dosed based on his INR levels.  
The surgical Silverlon dressing was found to be clean and intact 
without erythema or abnormal drainage. Labs were checked 
throughout the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the 
time of discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and 
feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. 
 The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is NON-weight bearing on the 
operative extremity.
 
He is discharged to rehab in stable condition.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with past medical history 
significant for ITP, DM2, HTN who presents with coffee ground 
emesis and small BRBPR with outpatient labs notable for plts < 
5, prompting inpatient referral for concern for recurrent 
thrombocytopenia.

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============= 
# ITP: Patient was diagnosed with ITP about a month ago and is 
followed at ___ for her care. Her treatment course previously is 
as follows: oral dexamethasone 40 mg daily x 4 days (___), IV Ig 1 g/kg on ___ and ___, 
Prednisone 90 mg daily started on ___ tapered to 60 mg, 
Rituximab 375 mg/m2 4 doses recently completed, Promacta 50 mg 
daily started on ___ - ?___. Differential diagnosis in 
the past has included aplastic anemia vs thrombocytopenia 
predominant MDS, however these were felt less likely than ITP. 
___ was weakly positive at 1:40 last admission, anti-histone 
antibody was negative. HIV and HCV negative. HBV viral load 
negative but positive surface and core antibody, suggesting 
clearance of HBV. On last admit, heme thought the patient likely 
had steroid-refractory ITP, and likely rituximab was causing her 
platelets to go up during that admission. She was supposed to 
undergo a taper of her oral prednisone but this had not been 
started prior to her current hospitalization. Of note, the 
patient has been very frustrated with multiple hospital 
admissions in the past month. Bone marrow biopsy performed on 
___ had not returned by discharge but prelim review showed no 
overt leukemia, lymphoma or dysplasia. Heme onc followed her on 
this admission and she received higher dose prednisone 120 mg 
daily and NPlate 84 mcg on ___ platelets have since risen from 
<5 to 101 with this treatment. She will follow-up with Dr. 
___ in clinic on ___ for follow-up and steroid taper. She 
has been continued on Pantoprazole, Bactrim, and Vitamin D to 
avoid steroid-induced complications. Splenectomy was considered 
on this admission however given her improvement with medical 
management, this option has been deferred at this time. She 
received Hib, PCV13, and Trumenba prior to discharge and will 
need follow-up vaccines listed below in preparation for possible 
splenectomy. 

# T2DM: Prior to this hospitalization, she was on metformin, QHS 
lantus and standing mealtime and QHS humalog. With persistent 
hyperglycemia while on high-dose steroids, her insulin regimen 
was adjusted as follows and should be continued as below until 
she sees her PCP:
[ ] Lantus 70 U at bedtime
[ ] Humalog: 20 units at breakfast, 20 units at lunch, 20 units 
at dinner, and 8 units at bedtime

# Vaginal bleeding: Stable/resolved. Likely in the setting of 
low platelets. Patient is pre-menopausal, and prior to 
development of ITP, she had regular periods every 4 weeks. 
Somewhat heterogenous endometrium was seen on CHA vaginal US. 
During her last admission, OBGYN was consulted and felt it was 
non-specific with low-suspicion for underlying malignancy. 
Norethindrone was discontinued at that time. Only light vaginal 
spotting was seen at last hospital discharge. Treated ITP as 
above. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
=============== 
# Steroid-induced Gastritis, Dyspepsia: Last admission, the 
patient was placed on pantoprazole 40mg QD and ranitidine 150mg 
PO BID for GI ppx iso steroid use due to new cramping epigastric 
discomfort. Likely gastritis I/s/o steroid use. H pylori 
serology positive, infection can be associated with worsening of 
ITP. She will need a repeat stool H. Pylori testing 2 weeks 
after discontinuation of prednisone. She was continued on 
pantoprazole and ranitidine.

# HBV: Patient with HBV core and surface Ab positive, viral load 
negative. She was started on entecavir last admission to prevent 
HBV recurrence while on rituximab. She will continue on 
entecavir pending decision for immunosuppression. 

# HTN: Continued home amlodipine.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were seen at ___ for very 
low platelets and minor bleeding. Our hematology doctors saw ___ 
and recommended admission to the internal medicine service for 
medication management. You were given high dose steroids and 
platelet medications and your platelets saw a gradual increase 
by your discharge dates. Given improvement in your labs and lack 
of significant bleeding, your hematology and surgical teams feel 
that it is safe to continue your management on steroids at this 
time. In the future if your symptoms worsen, you may require 
surgery to remove your spleen.

While hospitalized, you received vaccines that will protect you 
against infections that are life threatening in the event that 
you need your spleen removed. You will need repeat vaccines 
based on a schedule listed below that you should discuss with 
your PCP.

Since you are now on high dose steroids, this will affect your 
blood sugars and your insulin regimen has been increased 
appropriately (see below). Please record your blood sugars with 
meals and at bedtime and bring this log to your PCP. You have 
also been started on antibiotics, Vitamin D, and acid reflux 
medication to prevent complications that can develop with 
steroid use. Please continue to take these medications as 
prescribed.

It is imperative that you see your PCP and attend your follow-up 
appointments listed below.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
========
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of colonic polyp, 
chronic hepatitis B infection, coronary artery disease, 
ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p ICD, colonic polyps, not on blood 
thinners, and no history of GI bleed, who presented with acute 
GI bleed. He was initially admitted to the MICU because of 
elevated lactate and downtrending H/H despite 2u pRBCs 
transfused. Patient was stable in ICU overnight after admission 
and was called out to medicine floor the next day. He underwent 
colonoscopy before coming to medicine floor which 
re-demonstrated known diverticular disease and a polyp but 
showed no evidence of active bleeding. On ___ patient continued 
to have bloody bowel movements and was transfused an additional 
unit of pRBCs. A CTA abd/pelvis was performed to look for an 
occult source of bleeding which did not find a source of active 
bleeding. He continued to have BRBPR ___ and was transfused an 
additional 1u pRBCs. H/H uptrended ___ and remained stable 
through the day of discharge. Patient had ongoing small amounts 
of dark colored stool during the ___ days prior to discharge. 
GI felt the picture was most consistent with a resolving lower 
GI bleed, possibly in the right colon given report of melena. 
On day of discharge patient was asymptomatic and 
hemodynamically stable saving mild tachycardia thought 
attributable to beta blocker withdrawal and improved after 
restarting home metoprolol.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
-Discharge Hgb: 9.6
[] Renal aneurysm mildly increased compared to prior. Should 
have repeat imaging as outpatient to follow up.
[] Will need repeat colonoscopy in ___ months, with polyp
removal
[] Patient's hgb stabilized prior to discharge at 9.6. Repeat 
CBC should be obtained on ___.
[] Patient's home aspirin held given recent GI bleed. Should be 
reinitiated at PCP's discretion.
[] Patient with mild intermittent tachycardia during course of 
hospitalization thought secondary to held metoprolol. 
Metoprolol reinitated prior to discharge. Heart rate should be 
monitored during PCP follow up.
[] Patient with GI bleed without clear source, but thought 
secondary to resolved lower GI bleed. Should patient have 
additional episode of BRBPR, patient should be re-evaluated by 
gastroenterology. 
 
ACUTE ISSUES  
===============  
# GI Bleed, presumed lower
# Acute blood loss anemia:
Etiology initially felt to most likely be diverticular. 
Underwent colonoscopy ___ which again demonstrated 
diverticulosis and a 4 mm polyp but no active bleeding. ___
patient  continued to have bloody bowel movements so a CTA was
obtained  without evidence of active bleeding. Continued to have
bloody  bowel movements with downtrending H/H ___ requiring
additional  transfusion. As of ___ patient's H&H stabilized and
patient  tolerated a regular diet. Patient was monitored for
additional  time given ongoing dark colored stool which GI felt
was most  consistent with residual blood from likely resolving
lower GI  bleed without need for additional diagnostic studies
inpatient.  Patient required 3 units pRBCs transfused during
admission, with last blood transfusion on ___.

# Tachycardia
Patient noted to be tachycardic on admission. Thought most 
likely from intravascular depletion. Initially resolved with 
transfusions and IVF; however, tachycardia recurred on ___ 
likely in the setting of held home metoprolol and resulting 
beta blocker withdrawal. Hgb was otherwise stable, EKG was 
consistent with sinus tachycardia, and patient was without any 
additional symptoms concerning for acute GI bleed. Patient was 
reinitiated on home metoprolol with improvement and plan for 
follow up with PCP in the outpatient setting. 

# Lactic acidosis 
Lactate 5.6 in ED, improved to 1.6 after transfusions and IVF. 
Likely poor perfusion from volume depletion.

# Thrombocytopenia: 
Initially low ___ but improved 170's on day of discharge. 
Unclear etiology possibly liver dysfunction from chronic HCV 
versus consumptive process in setting of bleed.

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
===============  
# Coronary artery disease, LAD TO, LCx 60% ___
# HFrEF, ischemic, ___ s/p ICD placement
ICD placed ___ and recently interrogated ___ with 
acceptable battery life and stable chronic lead parameters. 
While acutely bleeding his home aspirin, furosemide, 
irbesartan, and spironolactone were held. Metoprolol 6.25mg Q6H 
was initially continued but held on ___. On discharge, 
patient had been reinitiated on furosemide, spironolactone, 
losartan (irbesartan not on formulary in hospital; therefore 
losartan initiated at equivalent does), and metoprolol. 
Patient's aspirin was held on discharge with PCP made aware.

# Chronic hepatitis B infection
Liver biopsy in ___ showed stage I liver fibrosis. His most 
recent LFTs are normal with normal ALT and AST. Continued 
entecavir 0.5 mg daily for viral suppression

# Hyperlipidemia
Continued rosuvastatin 40mg daily

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  

WHY WERE YOU IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You were admitted to the hospital because you were having 
bloody bowel movements

WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?  
-You were given blood and fluids to replace what you had lost.
-You were initially admitted to the ICU for close monitoring 
then transferred to a general medicine floor once it was 
determined that you were more stable.
-You had a colonoscopy which showed diverticula (outpouchings of 
your colon) and a small polyp but no source of active bleeding. 
You continued to have bloody bowel movements so we performed a 
CT scan of your abdomen which also did not find the source of 
your bleeding.
-Ultimately it was felt that your bleeding was likely from one 
of your diverticula and ended up stopping on it's own. We feel 
that the ongoing dark bowel movements you had on the day you 
left the hospital were likely your body getting rid of old 
blood. Once we felt that you had truly stopped bleeding and your 
blood counts were stable, you were discharged home.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AFTER YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
- Continue to take all your medicines as prescribed below. 
- Show up to your appointments as listed below.
- Return to the emergency room if you have any of the danger 
signs listed below.
- Monitor your stools at home. If you notice bright red blood in 
the toilet or loose, black stools, you should present to the 
emergency department as this may indicate a second bleed.

We wish you the best!  

Sincerely,  

Your ___ Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M who presented to ___ s/p fall 
from roof.  He had +LOC and he was found to have a small left 
pneumothorax, pulmonary contusions, b/l distal radius fractures, 
splenic laceration with pseudoaneurysm . In the ED, the 
patient's right wrist was reduced by orthopedic surgery and both 
wrists were splinted.  The patient was taken to Interventional 
Radiology and attempted distal splenic artery embolization, 
however during the procedure, the patient moved his leg and 
tried to get off the table and he developed a proximal splenic 
artery disection. He, therefore, underwent splenic embolization 
proximally with a large plug.  The procedure went well.  HCTs 
were trended and the patient received 1u PRBC.  After 1U PRBC, 
HCT remained stable. The patient had repeat imaging, including a 
CTA on HD3 and HD7 which demonstrated decrease in the size of 
the retroperitoneal hematoma and that the splenic artery 
reconstitutes distal to the Amplatzer plug through collateral 
vessels. Once HCTs were stable, the patient was started on a 
regular diet which he tolerated well.  Given that the patient is 
on methadone at home, the Chronic Pain Service was consulted and 
medication recommendations were provided and implemented.   

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.
