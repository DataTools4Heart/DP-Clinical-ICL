PERTINENT IMAGING/STUDIES: 
==========================
___ CXR (Portable): 
IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the 
monitoring and support devices are unchanged.  The a OG tube 
extends to the upper stomach, though the side port appears to be 
at the level of the esophagogastric junction.  The tube should 
be pushed forward several cm for optimal positioning. The 
patient has taken a better inspiration.  Opacification at the 
left base most likely represents atelectasis.  Opacification at 
the right base medially could also represent atelectatic 
changes.  However, either or both of these could represent 
developing aspiration pneumonia in the appropriate clinical 
setting. 
 
___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence for acute intracranial abnormalities. 

___ CT SPINE W/O CONTRAST: 
1. No evidence for a fracture. 
2. Minimal retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 is most likely 
degenerative, though 
there are no comparison exams to confirm chronicity. 
3. Mild multilevel degenerative disease. 

___ CT CHEST ABD/PELVIS W/ CONTRAST: 
IMPRESSION:  
1.  No fracture or acute traumatic injury. 
2.  Bilateral aspiration in lower lobes of lungs. 
3.  Hepatic lesions enhancing similar to portal vein could be 
large 
hemangiomas.  Recommend further evaluation with ultrasound. 
4.  Hepatosteatosis. 

___ Shoulder and knee xrays - no fracture

Abdominal ultrasound ___:
1. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease 
including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot 
be excluded on the basis of this examination. 
2. A 2.2 cm hypoechoic lesion in the right lobe liver dome 
likely corresponds to one of the hyperenhancing lesions seen on 
prior CT.  Appearance is not the typical echogenic appearance of 
hemangioma.  Differential includes atypical appearance of 
hemangioma, hematoma, or other primary liver lesions.  
___ MRI is recommended for further characterization. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  ___ MRI is recommended for further 
characterization. 

___ Lumbar MRI:
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Mild degenerative changes throughout the lumbar spine with no 
significant 
spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. 
2. Disc bulge at ___ abuts but does not displace the 
transiting right S1 
nerve root.  Recommend correlation with right S1 radiculopathy. 
3. ___ and incompletely imaged/characterized oblong, 
oval signal 
abnormality in the left psoas muscle, with no enhancement seen 
on the recently performed CT, potentially representing a small 
intramuscular hematoma in the setting of trauma, however there 
is no significant surrounding edema pattern and the lesion does 
appear fairly ___.  Recommend a ___ 
___ with ___ lumbar spine MRI 2 document the 
absence of an underlying mass lesion. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  ___ lumbar spine MRI for 
further 
evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of ETOH abuse and 
withdrawal seizures, depression, anxiety, and hypertension, who 
presented with ETOH intoxication, seizures, and respiratory 
failure. He was intubated in the ED due to concern for airway 
protection in the setting of seizure activity and ETOH 
withdrawal, now extubated and on phenobarbital taper.

# ETOH ABUSE & WITHDRAWAL
Recurrent, heavy use c/b withdrawal seizures. Recent 
psychosocial stressor includes divorce. He was started on the 
Phenobarb protocol with Ativan for breakthrough while in the 
ICU. He was also given IV thiamine, folate, and MVI. Social work 
was consulted for additional support. Depression and anxiety 
were treated, as below.  Upon arrival to the floor, he has no 
further symptoms of withdrawal.

# SEIZURES:
Patient presented with ___ activity, thought to be due 
to recurrent ETOH withdrawal in the setting of recent heavy use. 
Head CT and MRI showed no evidence of structural disease. No 
other metabolic cause was identified. Neurology was consulted, 
and he was placed on EEG. While in the ICU, he had ___ 
activity x1, but EEG was consistent with pseudoseizures. He was 
initially started on Keppra 500mg BID, which was weaned off on 
___. Neurology recommended that patient be monitored with 
continuous video EEG monitoring until off phenobarbital.  
Suspect pseudoseizure, especially given that patient had high 
EtOH and was placed on phenobarb making breakthrough seizure 
less likely.  No antiepileptic medications were recommended at 
discharge.  No driving for 6 months.

# HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS:
Patient was extubated on ___ without difficulty, and was 
transitioned to nasal cannula. He was treated for CAP, as below.

# Community acquired pneumonia: 
Patient aspirated during seizures, and had evidence of pneuomina 
on admission CXR, so he was treated with a ___ course of 
CTX/Azithro (Day 1 was ___. 

# TRAUMA with left shoulder pain.
Patient had been found at the bottom of a flight of stairs, 
parents do not think he fell down many since no thud heard but 
history unclear. CT torso and Cspine imaging without clear 
injury. After extubation, he had left shoulder pain. This in 
fact predated this injury as he timed it to a recent skiing 
accident.Shoulder ___ showed no acute fracture. He was left 
in ___ collar but then subsequently cleared by orthopedics 
on ___. His pain was controlled with Toradol, and 
Acetaminophen, with Morphine, but with inadequate pain control.  
He was transitioned to oxycodone (given one week supply), 
flexeril and ibuprofen at the day of discharge.  He was advised 
to follow up with orthopedics after discharge.

# Right leg weakness.
On neurologic exam, he was found to have right leg weakness, as 
well as right inner thigh numbness.  The neurology team 
localized this to a possible L1 injury.  He underwent lumbar MRI 
which showed a possible S1 disk protrusion, but no L1 injury.  
He was discharged with neurology follow up in 2 weeks for 
___ and consideration of EMG if his weakness is persistent.

# DEPRESSION / ANXIETY
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended Seroquel 12.5 BID for 
anxiety.  As his follow up was not clear, this was not continued 
at discharge, and psychiatric care can be pursued as an 
outpatient.  

# Hepatic hemangiomas and steatosis: LFTs were monitored. 

# HTN: amlodipine restarted on ___, restarted hctz/lisinopril 
at discharge.

Transitional issues:
Alcoholism - advised not to drive for 6 months after unclear 
seizure.  Seen by social work and advised to follow up for 
therapy
Left shoulder pain - orthopedic evaluation in 1 week
Right leg weakness, foot drop, numbness - neurologic evaluation 
in 2 weeks
Abnormality on lumbar MRI - needs follow up MRI within 2 months.

Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
======================
[] Would recommend close monitoring of heart rate and titration 
of beta blocker as needed. He is near the maximum dose of 
metoprolol, so if atrial tachycardia reoccurs, could consider 
diltiazem as he responded well to that when briefly on this as 
an inpatient (however would avoid if possible given systolic 
heart failure).

[] Please monitor volume exam and adjust diuretic dose as 
needed.

[] The patient has had recent falls at home. ___ evaluation here 
noted unstable gait and falls risk; recommended discharge to 
rehabilitation, but the patient refused. He was deemed to have 
capacity to make such a decision, so patient was discharged 
home. Please continue to assess falls risk, continue discussions 
with patient regarding safety at home.

[] INR subtherapeutic on day of discharge. According to his 
pharmacy, his home dose is 5mg per day. We administerd 7.5mg on 
day of discharge (___) with instructions to take 5mg per day 
thereafter. Please monitor INR and dose warfarin accordingly.

SUMMARY
=========
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with PMH most significant for 
atrial
flutter and atrial arrhythmia s/p CTI line and PVI, DCCV, HFrEF
thought to be tachyarrythmia induced, MGUS, CKS, PAD, and recent
pseudomonas osteomyelitis complicated by fungemia who presented 
with lower extremity weakness and falls. This was felt to be 
secondary to atrial tachycardia with frequent pauses. A 
biventricular pacemaker was placed and rate control agents 
titrated. He was also slightly fluid overloaded, so the patient 
was diuresed to euvolemic.

ACUTE ISSUES
==============
# Symptomatic pauses s/p BiV PPM
# Atrial tachycardia
The patient has a history of afib/flutter with RVR, s/p prior 
ablations. He presented with weakness and telemetry monitoring 
was revealing for alternating atrial tachycardia and sinus 
rhythm with symptomatic conversion pauses. A biventricular 
pacemaker was placed on ___. He was continued on warfarin 
per his outpatient cardiologist, Dr. ___. Rate control 
medications were titrated and the patient was ultimately 
discharged on his prior metoprolol succinate dose of 200mg BID. 
Of note, telemetry showed that he was in NSR for several days 
prior to discharge.

# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure 
Prior echocardiography with EF 21%, mild-mod MR, and mild TR. 
The patient presented with mild volume overload as evidenced by 
___ edema in ___, elevated JVP, and crackles over the lung 
fields, as well as 4 kg above his previous discharge weight. He 
was diuresed down ___ with improvement of his physical exam. 
The patient was discharged on 40mg PO Lasix (increased from 
prior home dose of 10mg daily), metoprolol as discussed above, 
as well as home hyrdralazine and Isordil.

# Anemia 
Patient with documented hypoproliferative anemia and MGUS. 
Previously requiring blood transfusions during last admission. 
H/H this admission slightly lower than baseline but overall 
stable. Labs were consistent with mixed picture of mildly 
hypoproliferative marrow, anemia of chronic disease, and iron 
deficiency, without any signs of hemolysis. Hbg was 9.0 on day 
of discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES
====================
# CAD
There was no ischemia noted on a recent nuclear stress test 
___, although there was akinesis of the basal inferoseptum, 
basal-mid inferior and inferolateral walls on a ___ TTE. 
The patient was continued on home pravastatin 40mg and ASA 81mg.

# Stage 4 CKD
Baseline Cr 2.5. Chemistries and renal function were trended 
throughout admission. The patient was continued on home sodium 
bicarbonate 650 mg BID.

# PAD
S/p R AT angioplasty on ___. Per chart review, vascular 
surgery recommended post-op clopidogrel for one month 
post-operatively, but clopidogrel has been continued without 
clear indication. Per the patient's outpatient cardiologist, 
Plavix was discontinued.

# IDDM 
The patient was continued on long acting glargine, prandial 
insulin, and an insulin sliding scale. 

# BPH
The patient was continued on home finasteride and tamsulosin.

diverticulosis/LGIB but patient has never had colonoscopy. 
Initial plan for endoscopy deferred per patient's wishes. Hct 
stable s/p 2u pRBC. Supratherapeutic INR was reversed with 
vitamin K and Kcentra. Baseline anemia likely from to be 
AICD/CKD with component of iron deficiency. Patient's bleed 
stabilized off warfarin. Risk/benefit discussion was offered 
regarding restarting Coumadin, holding Coumadin, or a trial of 
heparin to watch for re-bleed. Patient prefers to hold Coumadin 
until seeing PCP. She expressed understanding of the risk of 
stroke. She received a b12 shot on ___ and was started on daily 
folic acid as well. 

# CAD s/p stenting: Patient had recent DES to LCx at ___. 
___ on ___. She was continued on ASA81 and 
prasugrel. Metoprolol XL 200mg was continued. 
Isordil/hydralazine was continued by discharge. She continues on 
enzetimibe given statin intolerance 

# Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure HFrEF (44%), 
biventricular
# Mod posteriorly directed MR

was dropped on her left foot. Xrays were previously negative. 
The foot caused her significant pain with notable. A repeat XR 
was negative for fracture as well. She had significant soft 
tissue swelling, ecchymosis. Supportive care with elevation and 
ice was offered. Podiatry recommended a surgical shoe and can 
follow up as an outpatient. Patient's oxycodone frequency was 
increased to q4h. 

# Depression
- continued wellbutrin 150mg

# ___ on CKD: Patient's base line CR 2.0-2.2. Discharged at 2.4, 
which has been stable.

# A-Fib: Warfarin was reversed with K-centra and vitamin K as 
above. Per patient preference, she wanted to discuss restarting 
anticoagulation with her PCP. She was continued on digoxin and 
metoprolol

# Diabetes  
- Continued home Glargine + ISS  

# Gout  
- Continued home Febuxostat  
- Continued home Methylprednisolone 4mg

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Discharge weight: 195.3 lbs
Discharge Cr: 2.4
[ ] continue to evaluate weights daily and metabolic panels 
weekly for whether patient's diuretic regimen can be changed. 
Discharged on 60 mg Torsemide PO BID
[ ] Please monitor CBCs weekly for anemia
[ ] Note patient is a difficult lab draw. She had a PICC line in 
place for her hospitalization. 
[ ] Discuss re-starting Coumadin for Afib.  In setting of recent 
bleed, would suggest avoiding triple therapy. Per WOEST trial, 
could consider Clopidogrel/Coumadin or by extension, 
prasugrel/Coumadin
[ ] Patient adamantly refuses colonoscopy. Consider alternative 
method of colon cancer screening given family history. 
[ ] Encourage supportive measures to reduce foot swelling
[ ] Titrate oxycodone back to q6hrs or even further spaced out 
as foot swelling resolves
[ ] Consider restarting spironolactone if creatinine stable
[ ] Attempt to stop omeprazole after 1 month

IMAGING: 
CXR ___
Subtle opacity projecting over the left upper lobe which could 
represent 
pleural parenchymal scarring.  However, oblique views are 
recommended for 
further evaluation to exclude a pneumonia. 

ECHO ___
PreTAVR Deployment
 Study is quite limited given large hiatal hernia and poor echo 
views especially transgastric and deep transgastric.
 The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is 
seen in the body of the left atrium. Regional left ventricular 
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). RV with normal free wall 
contractility. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. 
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are 
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The number of aortic 
valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets 
are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area <1.0cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. These findings were 
discussed with Drs. ___, and ___ at the time 
of exam.
PostTAVR Deployment
 There is a well-seated TAVR valve in place. Trace paravalvular 
regurgitation is noted. No new LV regional wall motion 
abnormalities are seen. Peak gradient is 9mmHg across the valve. 
The rest of exam is unchanged from prior. These findings were 
discussed with the procedural team at the time of exam in the 
operating room.  

ECHO ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and 
regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 63 %). Doppler 
parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left 
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal 
motion/position consistent with right ventricular 
pressure/volume overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. An ___ aortic 
valve bioprosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is 
normal for this prosthesis. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is 
probably present. The aortic valve VTI = 59 cm. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: A well seated aortic ___ valve is present with 
normal gradients and trace paravavluar aortic regurgitation. 
There appears to be varying PR interval - AV block cannot be 
exclude however echo is not a good modality to diagnose 
arrhythmia suggest obtaining an EKG to verify. Type II diastolic 
dysfunction with elevated LVEDP, moderate pulmonary hypertension 
and normal RV size and function.

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___,

Acute Issues:
=============
#Acute Kidney Injury 
#Concern for Hepatorenal syndrome 
The patient was discharged ___ from ___ on midodrine for 
management of acute kidney injury felt to possibly be secondary 
to hepatorenal syndrome. She was readmitted from clinic for 
increased ascites and need for a paracentesis. At that point, 
her Creatinine was lower than at her prior discharge (1.6 from 
1.9). She underwent a paracentesis ___. Creatinine then 
gradually increased. She was given IV albumin, octreotide and 
midodrine. Unfortunately her Creatinine continued to uptrend. 
She was then ruled in for the terlipressin trial on ___ and 
was enrolled into the study. However, her Creatinine did not 
improve while on the terlipressin trial. She was taken off of 
the study medication and restarted on midodrine and octreotide 
with ongoing worsening of her creatinine. Following several 
conversations with her family, decision was ultimately made to 
transition to CMO and she was discharged to a ___ facility. 
Her pain and comfort were treated aggressively.

#NASH Cirrhosis 
#Ascites
The patient was due for outpatient paracentesis on ___ 
however unfortunately had rapid reaccumulation of ascites and 
required a paracentesis sooner. She underwent a 6L paracentesis 
on ___ which significantly improved her symptoms. Diagnostic 
tap was negative for evidence of SBP. Due to her enrollment into 
the terlipressin trial, she was not tapped again until ___ 
when the trial was discontinued. She had another repeat 
paracentesis on ___ due to rapid reaccumulation. She was 
continued on ciprofloxacin prophylaxis while in the hospital. 
pleurX catheter was placed on ___ when she was transitioned to 
CMO. 

#Non-AGMA
Felt to be due to renal failure. She was started on oral 
bicarbonate but this was discontinued when she was made CMO.

___ TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM 
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is mildly 
enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial septal defect by 
2D/color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ 
mmHg. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a 
mildly increased/dilated cavity. There is mild global left 
ventricular hypokinesis. No thrombus or mass is seen in the left 
ventricle. Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection 
fraction is 42 %. Due to severity of mitral regurgitation, 
intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be lower. There 
is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Tissue 
Doppler suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP less than 12mmHg). There is normal diastolic function. 
Normal right ventricular cavity size with uninterpretable free 
wall motion assessment. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is 
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild 
[1+] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular wall thickness with mild 
cavity dilation and mild global systolic dysfunction c/w a 
nonischemic cardiomyopathy or myocarditis. Mild mitral 
regurgitation. Mild tricuspid regurgitation.

Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ , 
the findings are similar. Left ventricular cavity size was 
underestimated on the prior study.

___ TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM 
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is 
normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. 
Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 42 %. 
There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. 
Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall 
motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with 
normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch 
diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally 
normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild [1+] mitral 
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally 
normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion.

SUMMARY STATEMENT
=================
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a prior history of 
borderline hypertension and recurrent strep pharyngitis who 
presents with pharyngitis and chest pain and was found to have 
ECG changes and troponin elevation consistent with 
myopericarditis. A TTE revealed depressed LVEF of 40%. He did 
not show evidence of hemodynamic compromise, heart failure 
decompensation, conduction abnormality, or arrhythmia. His 
troponins started downtrending within 12 hours of admission. He 
was discharged on treatment for presumed bacterial pharyngitis 
and pericarditis.

ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES
====================
#Myopericarditis with global LV dysfunction (LVEF 40%) 
Mr. ___ presented with clinical signs of pericarditis 
(pleuritic chest pain) and ECG evidence of pericaridits as well. 
Troponins were elevated confirming concomittant myocarditis. A 
coronary angiography did not show coronary disease. Left heart 
catheterization did show elevated LVEDP of 21, and a TTE showed 
global LV dysfunction with LVEF 40%. He did not show signs of 
hemodynamic compromise, heart failure decompensation, conduction 
abnormality, or arrhythmia, despite evidence of elevated filling 
pressures. 

Etiology very likely to be related to recent pharyngitis 
infection, especially given concurrent pericarditis. There is 
case-report evidence of strep pharyngitis-associated myocarditis 
and pericarditis. He received IV toradol and steroids, and was 
started on a nitroglycerin and heparin gtt in the ED and his 
chest pain resolved. He did not have recurrent chest pain. 

Utox negative, few eosinophils on peripheral smear. Mild 
presentation not consistent with giant cell myocarditis. No 
other evidence of endocarditis. His cardiac biomarkers, 
including CK-MB and troponin T, were downtrending during his 
admission. Limited repeat TTE on the day of discharge showed 
stable mild LV dysfunction. Review of his telemetry revealed on 
occasional premature atrial depolarizations without any 
sustained supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias and no 
evidence of heart block. For treatment of his pharyngitis and 
myopericarditis:  

- Keflex ___ PO twice daily through ___ 
- Ibuprofen 800mg three times daily x 7d
- Ibuprofen 400mg three times daily x 7d
- Ibuprofen 400mg PRN after this 
- Strep culture and viral culture pending at discharge, but will 
treat with 7d course of keflex for presumptive strep pharyngitis 
given strong history of this
- Follow-up in heart failure clinic to be arranged after 
discharge
- Low threshold to restart colchicine if recurrent pericarditis 
symptoms 

#Pharyngitis
Extended history of bacterial pharyngitis including two episodes 
of peritonsillar abscess requiring drainage. Clear evidence of 
pharyngitis on exam without evidence of abscess. Culture taken, 
but after antibiotics already started. Will treat empirically 
for bacterial infection with 7d course of keflex ___ twice 
daily.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you while you were admitted to ___ 
___. 

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- You were having throat pain and chest pain. 

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?
- We found that you have inflammation of the heart muscle, and 
of the sack the surrounds the heart: this is called myocarditis 
and pericarditis. 
- Because your symptoms can be consistent with a heart attack, 
we did a procedure to look at the vessels in the heart (coronary 
angiography). This did not show any blockages or narrowing. 

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN YOU GO HOME?
- You are still at risk for cardiac complications. If you have 
difficult breathing, swelling in your legs, worsening fatigue, 
feeling lightheaded, call a doctor right away. You need to call 
___ or go to an emergency department if it feels like your heart 
is beating strangely or too fast, or if you pass out at any 
time. 
- Do not do any exercise until you see a doctor who tells you 
this is ok. Normal household activities are fine to do. 
- Buy a scale and take your weight every morning after getting 
up. If your weight goes up 3 pounds in a day or 5 pounds in a 
week, call your doctor right away. Your weight when you left the 
hospital was  209 pounds (94.8 kilograms). 
- Carefully review the attached medication list. 

Sincerely, 
Your ___ Care Team

RELEVANT STUDIES
=======================
___ TTE:
The left atrial volume index is normal. The right atrium is 
mildly enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial septal 
defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional 
and global left ventricular systolic function. Quantitative 
biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 66 %. Left 
ventricular cardiac index is high (>4.0 L/min/m2). There is no 
resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Tissue Doppler 
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP less 
than 12mmHg). Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with mild 
global free wall hypokinesis. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is depressed. The aortic sinus is mildly 
dilated with mildly dilated ascending aorta. The aortic arch 
diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic 
regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal with no 
mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There 
is mild [1+] tricuspid
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated right ventricle with mild free wall 
hypokinesis and mild pulmonary hypertension. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/ 
global systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY:
================
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old female with past medical history 
significant for autoimmune hepatitis s/p liver transplant ___, 
___ on tacrolimus and prednisone, recurrent DVTs on warfarin, 
and ulcerative colitis on mesalamine who presented to ___ 
with acute onset RUQ and epigastric pain and nonbloody vomiting 
on ___ found to have GPC bacteremia and imaging concerning for 
cholangitis. She underwent ERCP which showed a right 
intrahepatic stricture with upstream biliary scalloping and 
atypical cells on brushings. She received IV ceftriaxone/flagyl 
(D1 = ___, which were continued at discharge. 

ACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED:
======================
#Cholangitis 
#Transaminitis
#Strep anginosus blood stream infection
MRCP concerning for cholangitis and patient now with 2 blood 
culture bottles positive for GPCs now speciated as strep 
angiosus (___ group). Likely cholangitis with bacterial 
translocation. Clinically stabilized with antibiotics. She 
underwent ERCP ___ which showed R intrahepatic stricture with 
upstream biliary scalloping suggestive of cholangiopathy. Ddx 
includes ischemic stricture with secondary cholangiopathy, PCS 
and malignancy. Hepatitis serologies obtained, she is hep A and 
B non-immune and should have vaccinations, EBV negative and CMV 
VL non detectable. ___, AMA, ___ obtained and all negative. 
Cytology of brushings showed atypical cells, possibly consistent 
with PCS infection vs malignancy. She will require repeat 
brushings with her next ERCP 1 month after the first one. IgG 
subclasses obtained and IgG subclass 2 low. ___ consulted for 
drainage of bilomas seen on MRCP and deemed no intervention 
necessary at this time s/p ERCP. She was continued on 
ceftriaxone/flagyl (___), with plan for duration likely ___ 
weeks to be determined by ___ clinic follow up. She will 
require repeat ERCP in 4 weeks from ___.

#Autoimmune hepatitis s/p liver transplant ___: 
Patient with history of AIH s/p liver transplant in ___ at 
___. Tacro levels have been elevated to >15. The dose was 
downtitrated given goal trough this far out from transplant is 
usually ___, however further management deferred to outpatient 
hepatologist. She additionally has continued on budesonide for 
years, which was discontinued as it was unclear if patient had 
ongoing UC. She has also been on prednisone 10mg daily (recently 
downtitrated to 5mg daily in setting of recent dx DM). For 
immune suppression, lowered tacro to 1 mg BID from 1.5 mg BID at 
home given high levels. She was continued on pred 5mg daily. 
Contacted her transplant clinic (Dr. ___, at ___ 
___. Follow up appointment was made and informed 
patient of need for repeat ERCP. If ___ unable to follow up 
she will need f/u ERCP at ___ in four weeks. Transitionally, 
she should get repeat hep B vaccination (has had difficulty 
serocoverting in past); she should also get the hep A vaccine. 

#Tachycardia
Sinus tachycardia. Initially concerning for sepsis though 
patient is well appearing and adequately fluid resuscitated. 
Also component of rebound tachycardia from holding home 
metoprolol. She was given IVF and resumed on home metoprolol. 

#Electrolyte Abnormalities 
#Hypomagnesemia
#Hypokalemia
#Hypophosphatemia
Mg was 1.0 on arrival. Continued to waste Mg and K throughout. 
Hypomagnesemia is common in patients who have received solid 
organ transplants on tacrolimus Her 24 h urine collection was 
difficult to interpret in setting of repletion, but per renal 
likely represents increased urinary wasting in setting of 
hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Omeprazole may also play role in 
electrolyte disturbance, now switched to ranitidine. She is 
being discharged on BID magnesium supplementation and daily 
potassium supplementation. 

#DM2: Diagnosed 1.5 weeks prior to admission with ___, no hx of 
previous prediabetes. A1c 12%. She was restart glargine given 
hyperglycemia, recent DKA and 5 units Humalog TID w/ meals with 
insulin sliding scale. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
================
#HTN: 
Once stabilized, resumed home amlodipine 10mg and home 
metoprolol tartrate 75mg BID.

#Ulcerative Colitis: Resumed home Mesalamine 800mg TID. Held 
home budesonide given uncertainty of diagnosis.

#CAD: pravastatin 40mg daily 
#Recurrent DVT: resumed warfarin 72 hr s/p ERCP without a 
bridge. US study negative for DVT. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
#Cholangitis 
#Atypical brushings
Cytology brushings were abnormal from right intrahepatic biliary
branches: ""Atypical ductal epithelial cells and bile pigment.""
Differential includes ischemic stricture with secondary
cholangiopathy, PCS, and malignancy. 
[] Repeat ERCP 4 weeks from ___ to reassess/remove stent. 
Needs to be coordinated with home ___ 
___
[] Will need repeat biopsies on repeat ERCP to follow up 
atypical cells found on first set of brushings. Per Dr. ___, 
___ need
repeat biopsies of this area at next ERCP in ___. 

#Electrolyte disturbances

further workup outpatient.
[] Should follow up CMP one week of discharge while on repletion 
of K, Mg (please obtain on ___. 
[] Discharging on 800mg Magnesium Oxide BID and 20mEq K daily. 

#DVTs
[] INR to be followed up by PCP ___. MD). Pt 
has received 7.5mg of Warfarin for the last 4 days of her 
hospitalization. Last INR was 1.5.

#Diabetes:
[] Blood sugars should be closely monitored with titration of 
insulin as needed. 

#S/p liver transplant
[] Tacrolimus dose has been reduced to 1mg BID. Levels should be 
monitored closely and dosage adjusted as needed. Goal Tacro 
trough ___.

#Possible Ulcerative Colitis:
[] Budesonide for ulcerative colitis was stopped as patient 
already on significant immunosuppression with prednisone and 
tacro.
[] Patient should undergo colonoscopy as outpatient to determine 
activity of UC.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___, G1, P1, who had a spontaneous 
vaginal delivery on the morning of ___. Over the course 
of her labor, she had developed chorioamnionitis and was being 
treated with ampicillin and gentamicin. Following her delivery, 
she initially had a small amount of blood loss. However, she was 
then noted to have persistent vaginal bleeding.  Manual 
evacuation was performed initially at the bedside.  However, the 
patient continued to have significant vaginal bleeding due to 
uterine atony and there was a question of possible retained 
placenta and the decision was made to proceed to the operating 
room. She was found to have lower uterine atony and no evidence 
of retained placenta. She had a D&C and a bakri balloon placed 
with subsequently improved bleeding. She also received cytotec, 
Pitocin, hemabate, and methergine. Total blood loss in the labor 
and delivery room was estimated to be 1000 cc. She received 2 
units of packed RBCs with a subsequent hematocrit of 21.4. 

Post-partum she developed ___ likely due to hypovolemia which 
steadily improved. She had her bakri removed with stable 
bleeding. She completed 24 hours of ampicillin, gentamicin, and 
clindamycin.  

On ___ patient was discharged home in stable condition with 
appropriate follow-up scheduled.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you here at ___. 

Why you were here: 
- You were having chest pain that was reminiscent of your prior 
heart attacks. 

What we did: 
- We did a cardiac catheterization and found that 2 of your 
stents had become blocked off. These were opened up with new 
stents in the RCA and LAD. We also placed a third stent at the 
apex of the heart.

What to do when you go home: 
- It is important to take both aspirin and Plavix every day 
without missing any doses. If you miss any doses your stent 
could clot off and cause another heart attack. 
- Follow up with Dr. ___ your primary care doctor. 
- Please weigh yourself every day and call your doctor if you 
gain more than 3 lbs. 
- Return to the ER or call your doctor if you notice recurrent 
chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, leg swelling, or any 
other symptoms that concern you.  

We wish you the best! 

Sincerely, 
Your Care Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Deceased donor liver transplant with supraceliac aortic arterial 
conduit and repair of right diaphragm, ___.  Surgeons were 
Dr. ___ Dr. ___ with an intraoperative consult to Dr. 
___.  Intraoperative fluids: Cell Saver 160 cc, crystalloid 3 
L, Plasma-Lyte 1 L, albumin 1 L.  Post-operative chest x-ray 
revealed PA in right main pulm artery, NG tube in stomach, ETT 
in between clavicle and carina. Left lung field minor 
atelectasis. No pleural effusion or PTX. Post op liver U/S: 
Patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate waveforms.  The 
patient was resuscitated appropriately in the SICU. Antibiotics 
were discontinued after 24 hour course, his ___ was exchanged 
for a triple lumen CVL, and he was called out to the floor on 
POD#2.  At this time his arterial line and foley catheter were 
also discontinued.
.
The patient received routine induction immunosuppression to 
include Mycophenolate 1 gram pre-op and continued at 1 gram BID 
with good GI tolerance. Intra-op he received 500 mg Solumedrol, 
and started the solumedrol to prednisone taper per pathway, 
however the prednisone taper rate of decrease was dropped to 
every 5 days (instead of every 7) due to anxiety and possible 
steroid role.
Tacro was started on the evening of POD 1 with daily levels and 
dose adjusted per level. Discharge level was 11.6 and he is 
discharged on 2 mg BID.
.
On POD#3 he was offered a regular diet.  His foley catheter was 
replaced after he failed to void, and he was diuresed with 
intravenous Lasix.  

On POD#4 he was found to have a new oxygen supplementation 
requirement, first 3L NC and progressing to 10 L. After being 
placed on a non-rebreather, he was transferred to the ICU for 
high flow nasal cannula.  CXR revealed opacification of the left 
hemithorax concerning for pleural effusion, and a pigtail chest 
tube was placed.  A CTA of the chest was negative for PE, and he 
was intubated due to persistent hypoxia.  A right sided pigtail 
chest tube was also placed.  A dobhoff feeding tube was placed, 
and tube feeds were initiated.  He underwent bronchoscopic 
evaluation, revealing thick yellow secretions  A BAL was sent 
and empiric vanc/cefepime for possible pneumonia was initiated.  


On POD#5 he was extubated and weaned down on high flow nasal 
cannula.  He tolerated a clear liquid diet. 

On POD#6 he was advanced to a regular diet.  His chest x-ray was 
improved from prior.  His foley catheter was still in place for 
accurate urine monitoring.

On POD#7, ___, he tolerated a regular diet plus tube feeds, his 
urine output was satisfactory, and he had no further ICU needs.  
His lateral JP drain was removed, and his left pigtail chest 
tube was removed.  His foley catheter was removed after a dose 
of IV Lasix.  He was called out to the floor in good condition.

On POD#8, He was tolerating a regular diet. ___ was 
monitoring his blood sugars and adjusting his insulin as needed. 


On POD#9, His LFTs were slightly increased and he underwent 
ultrasound of the liver which demonstrated patent vasculature 
and good waveforms. A CXR demonstrated small pleural effusions 
and he was give Lasix to help reduce his volume overload.

On POD#10, ___, his other JP drain was removed and his dobhoff 
tube was removed with cessation of supplemental feeding. He 
continued to require insulin and he completed a 7 day coruse of 
cefepime for possible pneumonia. 

ON POD#___, ___, his WBC continued to be elevated. He remained 
afebrile and there was never purulent material coming from his 
drains. He underwent CT Torso with IV/PO contrast, which 
demonstrated small left pneumothorax, heterogenous fluid on the 
right base, and right subcutaneous emphysema. From ___, he 
was monitored with continued large amount of serous drainage 
from his chest tube. However, the amount was slowly down over 
these days and by ___ it put out less than 200cc over 24 hours. 
His chest tube was removed and his post pull was without 
pneumothorax. During this time period, his insulin regimen 
continued to be adjusted for improved blood sugars. On ___, he 
was deemed appropriate for discharge after the appropriate 
insulin management teaching, pharmacy teaching, and general care 
teaching. He understands that if he has any questions or 
concerns to give the transplant office a call.

101). He has a complicated oncological history after undergoing
multiple chemo regimens and multiple Whipple attempts with prior
hepatic abscess drained by ___ and history of cholangitis that 
was
treated. He has required multiple GI interventions via MRCP for

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: 

Pancreatic cancer stage IIA (T3N0M0)
- ___ Developed loose stool. 
- ___ Developed weight loss following TKR surgery despite
eating regularly. He reported increased frequency of his stools
for which he avoided lactose. 
- ___ He was seen by Dr. ___ who felt he had a
malabsorption from CF gene and f/u for this was started,
including an abdominal U/S to look at the pancreas. This
unfortunately revealed a 3.2 x 3.1 x 2.8 cm pancreatic head 
mass with PD dilatation worrisome for malignancy. Two
indeterminate hepatic masses were seen. 
- ___ He underwent EUS which revealed an ill-defined
pancreatic head mass w/o vascular involvement, which confirmed
moderately-differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. CA
___ found to be elevated to 492. 
- ___ CTA torso showed an ill-defined, infiltrative
hypoattenuating mass in the head of the pancreas, consistent 
with
adenocarcinoma, resulting in pancreaticobiliary ductal
obstruction, and with stranding extending to superior 
mesenteric and splenic veins. Hyperenhancing lesion in the dome
of the liver may represent hemangioma, however is incompletely
characterized on this split bolus examination. 
- ___ Underwent attempted Whipple resection.
Intra-operatively, he was found to have a large, inflammatory
carcinoma measuring 7-8 cm occupying the entire pancreas into 
the
uncinate and down to the root of the mesentery (and 
down by the superior mesenteric vessels). Due to the severity of
the inflammatory pancreatitis and the size of the tumor were
prohibitive to proceed with an attempt at safe
pancreaticoduodenectomy resection. As such, it was 
determined to be locally invasive and open CCY and double bypass
performed, fiducials placed. Of note, the liver was also
inspected intra-operatively and the possible hemangioma seen in
the dome on imaging was not seen or palpable and the liver 
looked
healthy overall. Uncomplicated post-op course. 
- ___ C1D1 FOLFIRINOX
- ___ C1D1 DF/HCC ___ CAT-IQ trial
- ___ C2D1 FOLFIRINOX + Neulasta
- ___ CTA torso showed stable disease, new line 
associated
clot. Holding isoquercetin and switch to enoxaparin. 
Chemotherapy
hold for toxicity
- ___ C3D1 FOLFOX6 (holding IRI from FOLFIRINOX)
- ___ - ___ Admitted with fever, found to have Ecoli
bacteremia. 
- ___ C3D15 FOLFIRNOX (IRI reduced by 50% to 90 mg/m2)
- ___ SBRT to tumor
- ___ held FOLFIRINOX given stomach pain, fatigue, LFTs up
- ___ FOLFOX, found to have UGT1A1 polymorphism
- ___ CTA torso showed decrease in the pancreatic mass 
and
no metastatic disease. Felt to represent resectable disease
- ___ Taken to the OR for curative attempt with a 
Whipple.
Liver lesions noted during the procedure. Biopsies were taken 
and
fresh sections read as adenocarcinoma, so Whipple was aborted.
Final pathology showed biliary hamartomas however. 
- ___ MR abdomen showed 2.9 x 2.7 cm pancreatic head mass
contacting the SMV less than 90 degrees with associated distal
pancreas atrophy. No definite metastases in the abdomen,
including liver.
- ___ Third attempt at Whipple found inoperable vascular
involvement at the SMV root
- ___ CT torso showed stable locally advanced disease, no
metastatic disease
- ___ CTA showed continued gradual decrease in size of
pancreatic mass, no metastatic disease

RELEVANT STUDIES
=============================
___ EGD:
Blood in the esophagus. Unable to visualize most of stomach 
mucosa. Not able to visualize known two large ulcers due to 
large blood clot that was unable to be displaced. Jejunal limbs 
not seen due to blood. Duodenum not visualized due to anatomy. 
Procedure aborted due to poor visibility, large blood. Otherwise 
normal EGD to stomach

___ EGD
Duodenum not seen due to post surgery anatomy.
The alimentary limb was explored for 20 cm without blood or 
bleeding. Two jejunal diverticula were seen, without evidence of 
bleeding.
No active bleeding was seen. No visible vessels or high risk 
stigmata were seen. Previous RNYGB of the stomach
Ulcers in the gastrojejunal anastamosis
An OG tube was present at the initiation of the procedure. This 
was removed.
A dobhoff was blindly placed through the right nare into the 
esophagus. It was manually advanced, and once in place 
endoscopically it appeared to be entering the alimentary limb.
Otherwise normal EGD to 20 cm into alimentary jejunal limb

___ EGD
Esophagus: Normal esophagus. 
Stomach:  
 Lumen: Evidence of a previous RNYGB was seen.  
 Excavated Lesions Two ulcers ranging in size from 5 mm to 9 mm 
were found at the gastrojejunal anastamosis. The linear ulcer on 
the anastamotic scar was notably decreased in size. The round 
ulcer between the jejunal limbs appeared slightly decreased in 
size. There was no spontaneous bleeding or stigmata of bleeding. 
  
 Other Two staples were encountered at the site of the 
anastamotic ulcer.   The two staples were successfully removed 
using a jumbo forceps. Very minimal oozing was noted, which 
stopped without intervention.   
Duodenum:  
 Other duodenum not visualized due to post surgical anatomy.  
Impression: Duodenum not visualized due to post surgical 
anatomy.
Ulcers in the gastrojejunal anastamosis

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year of female with a history of obesity 
s/p Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, known large gastrojejunal ulcer, 
severe PVD s/p multiple vascular interventions (most recently 
s/p BKA on ___, and chronic back/extremity pain on methadone 
who presented with hematemesis ___ GJ anastomosis ulcer. 

# Acute blood loss anemia:
# Hematemesis:
# GJ Ulcer:
Patient presented from her rehabilitation facility with 
hematemesis. HGB had dropped from 8.2 to 6.6. Of note, patient 
was hospitalized at ___ from ___ for BKA. She received 4 
units pRBC during her MICU stay with appropriate response. She 
was placed on IV PPI which was transitioned to PO PPI after 
stabilization of H/H. During prior hospitalization, patient 
underwent 5 EGDs for UGIB with known gastrojejunal ulcer that 
could not be intervened upon due to large, adherent clot 
present. GI, Bariatric Surgery & ACS were consulted for 
management. GI performed EGD ___ & saw large blood in the 
stomach w/o further visualization.  Repeat EGD ___ which 
showed 2 excavating ulcers at the GJ anastomotic junction. She 
was hemodynamically stable and transferred to the floor where 
she had no further signs of bleeding. Bariatrics was consulted 
as below. EGD performed on ___ that removed two staples 
without complication. Discharge Hb/Hct 9.___.3. 

# History of RNY Gastric Bypass:
# Severe protein calorie malnutrition
Poor nutrition likely impairing ulcer healing and would make 
surgery higher risk. Albumin is currently 1.7. Per bariatric 
surgery team, the albumin needs to improve to 4 before reversal 
of gastric bypass. They have recommended enteral feeding but the
patient refuses placement of dobhoff tube. Dobhoff was initially 
placed under endoscopic guidance in the ICU but this came out. 
She refused further dobhoff placement. Given this barrier, she 
was given protein shakes three times daily. Nutrition was 
consulted and she was started on vitamin D and B12. Discharge 
albumin 1.8.

# Respiratory compromise given hematemesis:
She was intubated on admission given continued hematemesis. Once 
bleed stablilized, extubated successfully ___. 

# PVD s/p BKA: 
Home aspirin and clopidogrel were held upon admission given 
concern for ongoing, active bleeding. Vascular Surgery stated no 
utility in further ASA & clopidogrel in the setting of repeated 
bleeds. Continued statin therapy. 

# Chronic Pain: Home methadone held when on fentanyl for 
sedation. She was then restarted on home methadone.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Ensure follow up with her previous Bariatric surgeon at 
___ for discussion  and planning of reversal
[] Continue to closely monitor nutrition status and continue 
aggressive nutrient and protein supplementation. Trend weekly 
albumin. If albumin is not sufficiently improving on aggressive 
PO supplementation, would consider re-addressing enteral 
feedings.
[] Aspirin and Plavix stopped because of recurrent marginal 
ulcer bleeds. Would recommend stopping these medications until 
RNY reversal or further discussion with vascular and bariatric 
surgery. Can consider repeat EGD in 8 weeks to evaluate for 
healing of ulcers and considering restart of aspirin at this 
time in consultation with vascular surgery, GI, and bariatric 
surgery.
[] BID high dose PPI for 8 weeks beginning ___ then 
continue daily high dose PPI indefinitely
[] Minocycline had been prescribed for surgical site erythema 
but was stopped as this appeared improved to the vascular 
surgery team during this admission. If erythema returns, restart 
minocycline. 
[] Ensure follow up with Dr. ___ in vascular surgery in 2 
weeks.
[] NSAIDs should be avoided in this patient. NSAIDs added to  
allergy list.
[] consider adding back atenolol if need for blood pressure. 
Alternatively, consider metoprolol or increasing her current 
doses of HCTZ or lisinopril if renal function allows

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y.o. female with a recent diagnosis of 
recently diagnosed (dx ___ Stage IIIB/IV R. pancoast 
adenocarcinoma(no LN biopsy to determine whether stage IV but 
has enlarged LN on imaging with contralateral parenchymal lung 
nodules on CT scan), c/b invasion of brachial plexus and C7-T2 + 
T4 lesion who was admitted on ___ from clinic on ___ for 
urgent chemotherapy and radiation iso concern for permanent 
neurologic damage. She began C1D1 cispltain/pemetrexed + 
radiation on ___.

#Right pancoast adenocarcinoma
#Nerve root compression 
Ms. ___ was diagnosed with R. pancoast adenocarcinoma during 
her last hospital admission (___). Prior to this, she had 
not seen a provider ___ ___ years. Per Dr. ___ 
oncologist), her clinical stage is IIIB (T4N2M0) at minimum, but 
given concerning contralateral parenchymal lung nodules on CT 
scan, it is likely that she is stage 4. PET scan will determine 
the need for bronchoscopy and biopsy of mediastinal nodes. She 
began C1D1 of cisplatin + permextred on ___ and began the 
first of her radiation treatments (total 14 treatments) on 
___. She will follow up with Dr. ___ Dr. ___ in 
clinic for a total of ___ cycles of cisplain/pemetrexed and 
continue her radiation treatments (total 14 radiation tx) as 
planned. Prior to discharge, she reported improvement in her 
bilateral arm pain and improvement in R. hand numbness. Notably, 
she was able to use her R. hand to brush her teeth, which she 
was unable to do prior to admission. She was discharged on 
dexamethasone 4mg qAM, Bactrim, PPI, folic acid 1mg qd given 
pemetrexed use.

#RUE weakness
#Brachial plexopathy
#Bilateral arm pain:
As above, she will continue chemotherapy + radiation treatment. 
Her neurologic symptoms improved prior to discharge and she was 
discharged on dexamethasone 4mg qAM. She was continued on 
Tylenol and gabapentin for her pain.

# C7 vertebral compression fracture
# Destructive changes of T1 and T2 vertebral bodies, right sided 
facet joints at the C7-T1 and T1-2 levels
# Anterolisthesis of C7 on T1
She has known tumor invasion of C7-T2, and C7 vertebral 
compression fracture ___ tumor invasion. On her most recent
admission (___), spine surgery, hem/onc and radiation 
oncology made a decision to stabilize her compression fracture
with a brace (as opposed to posterior fusion spine stabilization 
surgery which would have required delaying chemo and radiation 
in order for her to recover/heal from surgery). Per Ortho, she 
will need to wear her C-collar at night and wear CTO brace at 
all other times. She is aware and amenable to this plan. 
Tentative plan to perform spine surgery 6 weeks after 
chemoradiation. 

# Biopsychosocial issues: 
Ms. ___ expressed concerns about her son, as he recently lost 
his brother (also her son) and father (ex-husband). She reports 
being less concerned about dying and more concerned about 
ensuring her son is set up with the business before she passes. 
They own an ___ together. Social Work and 
Palliative Care saw her while she was hospitalized, and she will 
have follow up with Palliative Care as an outpatient.

Surgical Course:

The patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy on ___, 
which went well without complication (Please see operative 
report for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, 
the patient arrived on the floor tolerating clear liquid diet, 
on IV fluids, and IV medication for pain control. The patient 
was hemodynamically stable.

Pain was well controlled. Diet was progressively advanced as 
tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. The patient 
voided without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient 
ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory 
toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in 
the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled. The patient was discharged home without services.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain. You 
developed a low blood pressure despite intravenous fluids and 
because of this, you were transferred to the intensive care unit 
for management. You were also reported to have elevated liver 
enzymes. You underwent imaging and found to have cholecystitis 
and you were started on a course of zosyn. You underwent an ERCP 
where a sphincterotomy was done with removal of sludge, stones 
and pus. Plastic stents were placed in the CBD and PD. You will 
have a follow up appointment with endoscopy to remove the 
stents. You were then taken to the operating room where you had 
removal of the gallbladder. During your hospitalization, you 
were found to have bacteria in your blood. The infectious 
disease service was consulted and you were started on a course 
of antibiotics.

Please have your blood work done at the ___ floor lab prior to 
your scheduled follow up appointment.

You have done well since surgery and are preparing for discharge 
home with the following instructions:      
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.

medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
