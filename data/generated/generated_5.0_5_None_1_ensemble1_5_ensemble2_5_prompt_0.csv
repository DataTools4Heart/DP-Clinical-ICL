HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

Mr. ___ is a pleasant ___ years old Male who presents to
___ ED for the further evaluation of fever at home (tmax of
101). He has a complicated oncological history after undergoing
multiple chemo regimens and multiple Whipple attempts with prior
hepatic abscess drained by ___ and history of cholangitis that 
was
treated. He has required multiple GI interventions via MRCP for
micro abscesses on the liver and he has been on prophylactic
Augmentin for the past three weeks. Temperatures at home have
been slowly climbing up, 99.4 last night but reached 101 this 
AM.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: 

Pancreatic cancer stage IIA (T3N0M0)
- ___ Developed loose stool. 
- ___ Developed weight loss following TKR surgery despite
eating regularly. He reported increased frequency of his stools
for which he avoided lactose. 
- ___ He was seen by Dr. ___ who felt he had a
malabsorption from CF gene and f/u for this was started,
including an abdominal U/S to look at the pancreas. This
unfortunately revealed a 3.2 x 3.1 x 2.8 cm pancreatic head 
mass with PD dilatation worrisome for malignancy. Two
indeterminate hepatic masses were seen. 
- ___ He underwent EUS which revealed an ill-defined
pancreatic head mass w/o vascular involvement, which confirmed
moderately-differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. CA
___ found to be elevated to 492. 
- ___ CTA torso showed an ill-defined, infiltrative
hypoattenuating mass in the head of the pancreas, consistent 
with
adenocarcinoma, resulting in pancreaticobiliary ductal
obstruction, and with stranding extending to superior 
mesenteric and splenic veins. Hyperenhancing lesion in the dome
of the liver may represent hemangioma, however is incompletely
characterized on this split bolus examination. 
- ___ Underwent attempted Whipple resection.
Intra-operatively, he was found to have a large, inflammatory
carcinoma measuring 7-8 cm occupying the entire pancreas into 
the
uncinate and down to the root of the mesentery (and 
down by the superior mesenteric vessels). Due to the severity of
the inflammatory pancreatitis and the size of the tumor were
prohibitive to proceed with an attempt at safe
pancreaticoduodenectomy resection. As such, it was 
determined to be locally invasive and open CCY and double bypass
performed, fiducials placed. Of note, the liver was also
inspected intra-operatively and the possible hemangioma seen in
the dome on imaging was not seen or palpable and the liver 
looked
healthy overall. Uncomplicated post-op course. 
- ___ C1D1 FOLFIRINOX
- ___ C1D1 DF/HCC ___ CAT-IQ trial
- ___ C2D1 FOLFIRINOX + Neulasta

- ___ SBRT to tumor
- ___ held FOLFIRINOX given stomach pain, fatigue, LFTs up
- ___ FOLFOX, found to have UGT1A1 polymorphism
- ___ CTA torso showed decrease in the pancreatic mass 
and
no metastatic disease. Felt to represent resectable disease
- ___ Taken to the OR for curative attempt with a 
Whipple.
Liver lesions noted during the procedure. Biopsies were taken 
and
fresh sections read as adenocarcinoma, so Whipple was aborted.
Final pathology showed biliary hamartomas however. 
- ___ MR abdomen showed 2.9 x 2.7 cm pancreatic head mass
contacting the SMV less than 90 degrees with associated distal
pancreas atrophy. No definite metastases in the abdomen,
including liver.

RELEVANT STUDIES
=============================
___ EGD:
Blood in the esophagus. Unable to visualize most of stomach 
mucosa. Not able to visualize known two large ulcers due to 
large blood clot that was unable to be displaced. Jejunal limbs 
not seen due to blood. Duodenum not visualized due to anatomy. 
Procedure aborted due to poor visibility, large blood. Otherwise 
normal EGD to stomach

___ EGD
Duodenum not seen due to post surgery anatomy.
The alimentary limb was explored for 20 cm without blood or 
bleeding. Two jejunal diverticula were seen, without evidence of 
bleeding.
No active bleeding was seen. No visible vessels or high risk 
stigmata were seen. Previous RNYGB of the stomach
Ulcers in the gastrojejunal anastamosis
An OG tube was present at the initiation of the procedure. This 
was removed.
A dobhoff was blindly placed through the right nare into the 
esophagus. It was manually advanced, and once in place 
endoscopically it appeared to be entering the alimentary limb.
Otherwise normal EGD to 20 cm into alimentary jejunal limb

___ EGD
Esophagus: Normal esophagus. 
Stomach:  
 Lumen: Evidence of a previous RNYGB was seen.  
 Excavated Lesions Two ulcers ranging in size from 5 mm to 9 mm 
were found at the gastrojejunal anastamosis. The linear ulcer on 
the anastamotic scar was notably decreased in size. The round 
ulcer between the jejunal limbs appeared slightly decreased in 
size. There was no spontaneous bleeding or stigmata of bleeding. 
  
 Other Two staples were encountered at the site of the 
anastamotic ulcer.   The two staples were successfully removed 
using a jumbo forceps. Very minimal oozing was noted, which 
stopped without intervention.   
Duodenum:  
 Other duodenum not visualized due to post surgical anatomy.  
Impression: Duodenum not visualized due to post surgical 
anatomy.
Ulcers in the gastrojejunal anastamosis

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year of female with a history of obesity 
s/p Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, known large gastrojejunal ulcer, 
severe PVD s/p multiple vascular interventions (most recently 
s/p BKA on ___, and chronic back/extremity pain on methadone 
who presented with hematemesis ___ GJ anastomosis ulcer. 

# Acute blood loss anemia:
# Hematemesis:
# GJ Ulcer:
Patient presented from her rehabilitation facility with 
hematemesis. HGB had dropped from 8.2 to 6.6. Of note, patient 
was hospitalized at ___ from ___ for BKA. She received 4 
units pRBC during her MICU stay with appropriate response. She 
was placed on IV PPI which was transitioned to PO PPI after 
stabilization of H/H. During prior hospitalization, patient 
underwent 5 EGDs for UGIB with known gastrojejunal ulcer that 
could not be intervened upon due to large, adherent clot 
present. GI, Bariatric Surgery & ACS were consulted for 
management. GI performed EGD ___ & saw large blood in the 
stomach w/o further visualization.  Repeat EGD ___ which 
showed 2 excavating ulcers at the GJ anastomotic junction. She 
was hemodynamically stable and transferred to the floor where 
she had no further signs of bleeding. Bariatrics was consulted 
as below. EGD performed on ___ that removed two staples 
without complication. Discharge Hb/Hct 9.___.3. 

# History of RNY Gastric Bypass:
# Severe protein calorie malnutrition
Poor nutrition likely impairing ulcer healing and would make 
surgery higher risk. Albumin is currently 1.7. Per bariatric 
surgery team, the albumin needs to improve to 4 before reversal 
of gastric bypass. They have recommended enteral feeding but the
patient refuses placement of dobhoff tube. Dobhoff was initially 
placed under endoscopic guidance in the ICU but this came out. 
She refused further dobhoff placement. Given this barrier, she 
was given protein shakes three times daily. Nutrition was 
consulted and she was started on vitamin D and B12. Discharge 
albumin 1.8.

# Respiratory compromise given hematemesis:
She was intubated on admission given continued hematemesis. Once 
bleed stablilized, extubated successfully ___. 

# PVD s/p BKA: 
Home aspirin and clopidogrel were held upon admission given 
concern for ongoing, active bleeding. Vascular Surgery stated no 
utility in further ASA & clopidogrel in the setting of repeated 
bleeds. Continued statin therapy. 

# Chronic Pain: Home methadone held when on fentanyl for 
sedation. She was then restarted on home methadone.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Ensure follow up with her previous Bariatric surgeon at 
___ for discussion  and planning of reversal
[] Continue to closely monitor nutrition status and continue 
aggressive nutrient and protein supplementation. Trend weekly 
albumin. If albumin is not sufficiently improving on aggressive 
PO supplementation, would consider re-addressing enteral 
feedings.
[] Aspirin and Plavix stopped because of recurrent marginal 
ulcer bleeds. Would recommend stopping these medications until 
RNY reversal or further discussion with vascular and bariatric 
surgery. Can consider repeat EGD in 8 weeks to evaluate for 
healing of ulcers and considering restart of aspirin at this 
time in consultation with vascular surgery, GI, and bariatric 
surgery.
[] BID high dose PPI for 8 weeks beginning ___ then 
continue daily high dose PPI indefinitely
[] Minocycline had been prescribed for surgical site erythema 
but was stopped as this appeared improved to the vascular 
surgery team during this admission. If erythema returns, restart 
minocycline. 
[] Ensure follow up with Dr. ___ in vascular surgery in 2 
weeks.
[] NSAIDs should be avoided in this patient. NSAIDs added to  
allergy list.
[] consider adding back atenolol if need for blood pressure. 
Alternatively, consider metoprolol or increasing her current 
doses of HCTZ or lisinopril if renal function allows

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain. You 
developed a low blood pressure despite intravenous fluids and 
because of this, you were transferred to the intensive care unit 
for management. You were also reported to have elevated liver 
enzymes. You underwent imaging and found to have cholecystitis 
and you were started on a course of zosyn. You underwent an ERCP 
where a sphincterotomy was done with removal of sludge, stones 
and pus. Plastic stents were placed in the CBD and PD. You will 
have a follow up appointment with endoscopy to remove the 
stents. You were then taken to the operating room where you had 
removal of the gallbladder. During your hospitalization, you 
were found to have bacteria in your blood. The infectious 
disease service was consulted and you were started on a course 
of antibiotics.

Please have your blood work done at the ___ floor lab prior to 
your scheduled follow up appointment.

You have done well since surgery and are preparing for discharge 
home with the following instructions:      
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until

YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.

lung 
consolidation concerning for pneumonia. 
2. Rounded mass in the right upper lobe is consistent with known 
malignancy. 

___ - CT Chest w/o contrast
Substantial progression since ___ and ___ of the 
tumor 
infiltration involving more than ___ of the right upper lobe, 
with progressive central adenopathy in both the right hilus and 
mediastinum.  Right upper lobe bronchus is narrowed but not 
occluded. 
  
Progressive cardiomegaly reflected in new, mild pulmonary edema 
accompanied by small to moderate, bilateral pleural effusions, 
and worsening of moderate to severe cardiomegaly, predominantly 
left ventricular and left atrial.  Severe coronary 
atherosclerosis.  Clinical significance is exaggerated by severe 
emphysema. 
  
Mild bilateral lower lobe bronchopneumonia. 

___ - ECHO
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global 
hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (multivessel CAD, toxin, 
metabolic, etc. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
Mild mitral regurgitation.

___ -CXR
Compared to chest radiographs ___ and one ___. 
New right pigtail pleural drainage catheter projects over the 
right lower 
lateral costal pleural space and there is less right pleural 
effusion.  No 
pneumothorax. 
  
The large, mass like region of consolidation in the right upper 
lung is 
attributable to locally aggressive lung cancer. Mild pulmonary 
edema has 
improved slightly, but small left pleural effusion has 
increased. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary 
vascular congestion persist.

64u to 80U glargine and insulin sliding scale. She completed her 
steroid course ___, and was put back on home insulin regimen. 
Just prior to discharge on ___, she had a milkshake and 
___ meal that her daughter brought. ___ blood glucose was 
found to be >400. 18U nighttime lantus given, recked 1 hour 
later, BS >500. Given 25u with BS down to 440s. Asymptomatic. 
Discharged home with ___ follow-up. 

# Anemia: Chronic. Likely anemia of chronic disease, c/w iron 
studies.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted because of difficulty breathing. We gave you 
oxygen and performed imaging of your lungs. We found that you 
had an infection of your lungs (pneumonia) that worsened your 
COPD, as well as a collection of fluid in your lungs which was 
drained with a chest tube. We treated you with antibiotics, 
steroids, and nebulizers to help treat the infection and the 
COPD flair. Please complete your remaining 3 days of doxycycline 
antibiotics at home as instructed.  During your stay you were 
also informed of your diagnosis of lung cancer from a previous 
lung biopsy. Please follow up with the cancer team (oncology) on 
___ for further care.

Your blood sugar was elevated prior to discharge. Please monitor 
your blood sugars more frequently for the next couple of days 
and contact your PCP if your BG <80 or BG >200.

Upon discharge, please weigh yourself every morning, call MD if 
weight goes up more than 3 lbs. Monitor yourself for fevers, 
chills, difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, or any other 
concerning symptoms that may be an indicator that the infection 
is worsening. Continue to use 2 Liters of oxygen during the day, 
in addition to your original amount of 2 liters of oxygen at 
night.

Please note that your warfarin dose was changed in the hospital 
to 4mg every day by mouth. Please follow up with your primary 
care physician on ___, ___ at 9am to have your INR 
checked, along with your potassium (which was low during your 
hospitalization), and have the stitch where the chest tube was 
placed removed.

Your home dose of carvedilol for your blood pressure was also 
cut in half per cardiology. Please set up care with a 
cardiologist once you leave the hospital (you will be receiving 
a call from the hospital to arrange this) to discuss the doses 
for you heart medications.

STUDIES
=======

-TTE ___
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
and cavity size are normal. There is paradoxical septal motion. 
The remaining segments contract well, but are not hyperdynamic. 
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe 
global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular 
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of 
tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal 
motion/position consistent with right ventricular 
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space 
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity 
dilation with free wall hypokinesis and tricuspid regurgitation. 
This constellation of findings is c/w acute pulmonary embolism 
or other acute pulmonary process. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ the 
findings are new.

There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with septal dyskinesis and anterior and 
anterolateral wall hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= ___. The 
right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate global free 
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position 
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Septal dyskinesis, anterior and anterolateral wall 
hypokinesis of the left ventricle with estimated EF ___. 
Right ventricular dilation and free wall hypokinesis with signs 
of volume and pressure overload.

-CTA ___
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 
2. Extensive diffuse airspace opacities throughout both lungs, 
right greater than left are new from ___, favoring 
flash pulmonary edema given rapid onset.  Pulmonary hemorrhage 
could also be considered. 

-TTE ___
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The 
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global 
free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve leaflets 
cannot be determined. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate [2+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Image quality too poor to 
interprete bubble study. Multiple attempts could not visualize 
with confidence LV cavity during bubble study to assess crossing 
of bubbles. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
visualized findings are similar. LV function could not be assess 
on the current study. The distal RV contracts well in 
conjunction with septal dyssynchrony indirectly suggest 
significant RV afterload elevation. TR jet was of moderate 
quality.  

CT Chest ___
On review of the serial radiographs there has been interval 
resolution/improvement of the initial pulmonary opacification 
(___), which is again has worsened after the radiograph 
done ___ These findings are most compatible with an 
initial episode of pulmonary hemorrhage which has partially 
resolved with now a second episode of hemorrhage. In the 
differential diagnosis consider superimposed pulmonary infection 
and less likely an inflammatory condition (organizing pneumonia) 
secondary to initial insult. 
  
Right IJV Swan-Ganz catheter in situ with the tip in a

vein. 
2. No DVT in the right thigh. 
3. Very limited study.  No DVT seen, although there was 
difficulty in 
compressing several sites on the left due to tenderness and 
edema.  The study could be repeated as needed if clinical 
suspicion persists.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx CREST syndrome, HTN, vasculitis, neuropathy, DVT, 
Factor V leiden, on coumadin, originally presented to OSH 
following an episode of syncope with complicated hospital 
course, transferred to ___ on ___ for management of 
severe pulmonary hypertension. Hospital course notable for ICU 
transfer following PEA arrest, volume directed management of 
pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary, and persistent hypoxemia. 
Patient was transferred to floor after weaned down on O2 and off 
of pressors. She continued diuresis on the floor and continued 
to improve. She was discharged to rehab. 

ACUTE ISSUES:  
=============
# PEA Arrest. On the morning o ___, patient collapsed in bed. 
CODE BLUE called for PEA arrest. ROSC was obtained after ___ min 
of CPR and 1 round of epi. Etiology of cardiac arrest was 
thought likely secondary to worsening pulmonary hypertension and 
flash pulmonary edema. She was transferred to the unit for 
pressure support and aggressive diuresis. She was significantly 
improved on discharge.   

# Pulmonary HTN. After PEA arrest, repeat TTE demonstrated 
increased dilation of RV cavity with severe global free wall 
hypokinesis progressed from prior TTE. Pulmonary consult was 
obtained. She was started on epoprostenol, which was then 
weaned. She had PA catheter placed for directed therapy. She was 
started on Sidenafil, increased to 20mg TID. She did well with 
diuresis and was discharged on 20mg Sildenafil and daily PO 
Lasix.   

# Hypoxemia. Following PEA arrest, patient was persistently 
hypoxic requiring high flow nasal canuala. CTA was negative for 
PE but was concerning for flash pulm edema vs ?pulm hemorrhage. 
There was consideration of steroids to treat empiric for 
possible inflammatory process, but this was deferred given prior 
scleroderma renal crisis and high risk of recurrence. She was 
managed with BIPAP then transitioned to high flow nasal canula, 
which was eventually able to be weaned to nasal canula and 
transferred to the floor. Her respiratory status continued to 
improve with aggressive diuresis prior to discharge.  She had 
decreased ___ of NC on discharge. She will continue to need 
diuresis as tolerated and continued weaning of O2. 

# Shock: hypotensive post arrest initially requiring epinephrine 
drip. Epinephrine was changed to levophed and dobutamine after 
she developed cool lower extremities and there was concern for 
developing cyanosis. Hypotension likely cardiogenic due to right 
sided failure given no evidence of infection. Dobutamine was 
stopped but she intermittently required levophed throughout her 
ICU stay. With optimization of her pulmonary hypertension and 
volume status, she was weaned off of pressors and transferred to 
the floor. She did well from a BP stand point. She was 
hypotensive on ___ due to aggressive diuresis which improved 
with 500cc of oral water intake. BP had dropped to ___ and 
improved to 100s systolics. 

# ___: creatinine 2.9 on admission, down from 5s at OSH after 
blood and fluid resuscitation. She was then thought to be 
acutely volume overloaded. She was diuresed and creatnine had 
improved to 1.1 by time of discharge.

# Factor V Leiden-Heterogenous: Patient has a hx of DVT. CTA was 
obtained post arrest and was negative for PE. Repeat LENIs 
negative. Anticoagulation was initially held for question of a 
possible hemorrhage, however she remained stable and was 
re-started on anticoagulation with apixaban 5mg BID.    
  
# CREST syndrome: followed by rheumatology here. Seen by 
rheumatology, who recommended avoiding all steroids given high 
risk of recurrent scleroderma renal crisis. Patient reported 
that she has not taken steroids for more than ___ years. 
  
# Anemia: s/p 2 units PRBCs at OSH, per d/c summary HCt has 
remained stable. Multiple stool guaiacs have been positive. Iron 
studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease. The patient 
required 1u PRBCs during her stay and she responded 
appropriately. Her hemoglobin otherwise remained stable 
throughout hospital course. She will need outpatient follow up 
for her anemia. 

# UTI: pan-sensitive E.coli growing at OSH s/p 3 day course of 
CTX (___).  

# C-DIFF Diarrhea: Patient developed c-diff positive diarrhea. 
She was started on Vancomycin PO on ___. The vancomycin course 
was prolonged after a concern for a UTI on ___ with two days of 
ceftriaxone. Her diarrhea has improved. She will continue the PO 
vancomycin until ___.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of alcoholic 
cirrhosis complicated by chronic ascites and pancreatic cancer 
s/p ___ (___) who is transferred for ERCP with concern for 
cholangitis. He presented on  to ___ on ___ 
after a mechanical fall. He stumbled and hit his nose without 
any loss of consciousness. Head CT was without intracranial 
bleed. He
was also noted to be hyponatremic to 124 and have worsening 
ascites and LFTs. There was no evidence of SBP on diagnostic 
tap. He was found to have Klebsiella bacteremia and was started 
on Zosyn. He had an MRCP that demonstrated new biliary ductal 
dilation with a change in the caliber at the anastomosis with 
the
duodenal limb. He was also noted to have a small nodular opacity 
within the common and right bile duct potentially representing 
sludge or debris. Over his hospitalization, his Na increased 
from 125 to 132. He was also noted to be confused and was 
treated for hepatic encephalopathy. 

In terms of his pancreatic cancer, it was diagnosed in ___ 
after a CT scan performed for evaluation of localized prostate 
cancer revealed concerning pancreatic changes. After further 
imaging, he was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team at ___ 
and he underwent endovascular repair of his aortic aneurysm 
followed by pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein 
reconstruction. Pathology revealed ductal adenocarcinoma, 
moderately
differentiated, grade 2. He was started on adjuvant gemcitabine, 
but was admitted during the first two cycles with sepsis of 
likely biliary etiology with enterococcal bacteremia. He also 
developed a pulmonary embolism during his hospitalization that 
was ultimately treated with Lovenox.  Thereafter, he was noted 
to have lower extremity edema and was started on furosemide. 

In ___, he had imaging that revealed a potential liver lesion 
and ascites. He was ultimately diagnosed with cirrhosis, likely 
alcoholic with possible contribution from chemotherapy. His 
ascites improved with furosemide and spironolactone. 

On arrival to the floor, the patient reports feeling tired and 
having some generalized stomach discomfort that he associates 
with his ascites. He also reports pain from hemorrhoids.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
=======================
___ M with ESRD on HD TThS, HFrEF (EF 30%), mixed 
cardiomyopathy, cor pulmonale ___ COPD/OSA, severe pulmonary 
HTN, chronic AF on warfarin, AV nodal disease s/p PPM ___ c/b 
device infection with new ___ device placement ___, HTN, 
HLD, probable CAD, DM who presents from dialysis with 
unresponsiveness
and hypotension.

#CORONARIES: unknown, suspected ischemic disease 
#PUMP: EF 30% (___) 
#RHYTHM: V-paced, HR 70 

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============= 
#Syncope - resolved
Presented for witnessed syncopal episode during HD concerning 
for cardiac etiology given sudden onset and rapid resolution, 
given patient's extensive cardiac comorbidities. Most likely in 
setting of fluid shifts during HD causing poor forward flow in 
setting of severe aortic stenosis causing poor perfusion in the 
setting of fluid shifts of HD. ACS less likely given trops at 
baseline (elevated in setting of ESRD). Seizure less likely 
given no definite post-ictal state or witnessed tonic clonic 
activity. Rapid neurologic recovery less consistent with TIA. Of 
note, TAVR eval and ICD previously deferred by outpatient teams 
due to invasive nature and functional status. Patient was given 
750 cc of fluid in the ED with improvement of blood pressure and 
mental status. Upon reaching the CCU his blood pressures has 
returned to baseline and he was feeling well. His device was 
interrogated on ___ which did not reveal any high rate events 
or malfunction of the pacemaker. 

#Hypotension - resolved
Patient with hypotension to ___ (lowest 66/46 while in ED) 
that improved after 750 cc fluid bolus. There was no report of 
fever, leukocytosis above baseline, findings on CXR, or 
localizing symptoms of infection to suggest sepsis. Normal 
mentation and normal lactate reassuring against shock. ___ 
related to hypovolemia/fluid shifting during HD given 
improvement with fluids.  

#HFrEF (EF 30%) 
#Mixed cardiomyopathy 
#severe low flow low gradient AS (valve area <1cm2) 
Patient with episode of syncope/hypotension potentially in 
setting of worsening. Less likely due to HF exacerbation - no 
evidence of frank pulmonary edema on CXR or and seems euvolemic 
on exam. Has had ongoing discussion with outpt cardiologist Dr. 
___ as to whether or not patient would want to pursue TAVR 
although per recent clinic note, further invasive therapies seem 
unwarranted at this point given his poor rehab potential (has 
been at rehab for over a year) and has multiple medical 
comorbidities. His home metoprolol was held in the setting of 
hypotension and restarted on ___. Patient is not on ___ 
due to baseline hypotension.  He should have continued 
conversations with Dr. ___ potential for TAVR if he 
becomes more symptomatic from his severe AS, or for potential 
biventricular ICD placement.

#Afib 
CHADS2VASC 6
On home warfarin and metoprolol. Initially held home metoprolol 
in setting of hypotension. Home metoprolol was restarted on 
___. His INR was noted to be sub-therapeutic at 1.7 and 
downtrended to 1.4. Patient was started on a heparin drip given 
high CHADs2VASC while continuing home warfarin with a goal INR 
___. Downtrending INR was a barrier to discharge and he remained 
on a heparin drip while bridging to therapeutic INR until 1.8 on 
day of discharge, thought to be acceptable in the absence of hx 
prior stroke or mechanical valve. Anticipate him to be 
therapeutic day after discharge. 

#ESRD on HD ___:
Recently started on HD three months prior through R IJ tunneled 
catheter. Nephrology was consulted who agreed that syncopal 
event likely related to excess UF in patient with low flow AS. 
Continued home sevelamer and nephrocaps. Last HD session on 
___ 

#Troponemia 
Trop-T to 0.13 and stable on repeat, similar to previously noted 
elevated Trop 0.11-0.15, likely in setting of ESRD. CKMB 4. No 
acute ischemic changes on ECG or chest pain. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
=============== 
#HLD #suspected CAD: Continued home atorvastatin 80 qPM. 

#COPD: Per rehab no longer on inhalers/bronchodilators, though 
noted to have a history of COPD. On home 2L O2 PRN O2>88%. Has 
not seen his pulmonologist in over ___ years - will set up follow 
up appointment for this. 

#T2DM: Placed on ISS. 

#GERD: Continue home famotidine.

#Depression: Continued home fluoxetine 

#OSA: Did not come in on home CPAP, should have pulmonology 
follow up to initiate CPAP if appropriate. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Due for HD on ___
[] Will require follow-up daily INR checks or earliest 
available. 
[] TAVR not currently appropriate option. Though continue to 
re-address at future cardiology follow-up. ___, CRT-D not 
within ___.
[] Consider decreasing metoprolol on HD days.
[] Consider lessening ultrafiltration for volume removal in 
setting of severe AS.
[] Will need to re-establish care with pulmonology to reconcile 
bronchodilators for COPD and CPAP for OSA

developed post-operatively. 
Please keep your incision dry until your sutures/staples are 
removed. 
You may shower at this time but keep your incision dry.
It is best to keep your incision open to air but it is ok to 
cover it when outside. 
Call your surgeon if there are any signs of infection like 
redness, fever, or drainage. 

Activity
We recommend that you avoid heavy lifting, running, climbing, 
or other strenuous exercise until your follow-up appointment.

STUDIES
=======

-TTE ___
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
and cavity size are normal. There is paradoxical septal motion. 
The remaining segments contract well, but are not hyperdynamic. 
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe 
global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular 
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of 
tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal 
motion/position consistent with right ventricular 
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space 
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity 
dilation with free wall hypokinesis and tricuspid regurgitation. 
This constellation of findings is c/w acute pulmonary embolism 
or other acute pulmonary process. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ the 
findings are new.

There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with septal dyskinesis and anterior and 
anterolateral wall hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= ___. The 
right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate global free 
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position 
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Septal dyskinesis, anterior and anterolateral wall 
hypokinesis of the left ventricle with estimated EF ___. 
Right ventricular dilation and free wall hypokinesis with signs 
of volume and pressure overload.

-CTA ___
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 
2. Extensive diffuse airspace opacities throughout both lungs, 
right greater than left are new from ___, favoring 
flash pulmonary edema given rapid onset.  Pulmonary hemorrhage 
could also be considered. 

-TTE ___
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The 
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global 
free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve leaflets 
cannot be determined. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate [2+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Image quality too poor to 
interprete bubble study. Multiple attempts could not visualize 
with confidence LV cavity during bubble study to assess crossing 
of bubbles. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
visualized findings are similar. LV function could not be assess 
on the current study. The distal RV contracts well in 
conjunction with septal dyssynchrony indirectly suggest 
significant RV afterload elevation. TR jet was of moderate 
quality.  

CT Chest ___
On review of the serial radiographs there has been interval 
resolution/improvement of the initial pulmonary opacification 
(___), which is again has worsened after the radiograph 
done ___ These findings are most compatible with an 
initial episode of pulmonary hemorrhage which has partially 
resolved with now a second episode of hemorrhage. In the 
differential diagnosis consider superimposed pulmonary infection 
and less likely an inflammatory condition (organizing pneumonia) 
secondary to initial insult. 
  
Right IJV Swan-Ganz catheter in situ with the tip in a

vein. 
2. No DVT in the right thigh. 
3. Very limited study.  No DVT seen, although there was 
difficulty in 
compressing several sites on the left due to tenderness and 
edema.  The study could be repeated as needed if clinical 
suspicion persists.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx CREST syndrome, HTN, vasculitis, neuropathy, DVT, 
Factor V leiden, on coumadin, originally presented to OSH 
following an episode of syncope with complicated hospital 
course, transferred to ___ on ___ for management of 
severe pulmonary hypertension. Hospital course notable for ICU 
transfer following PEA arrest, volume directed management of 
pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary, and persistent hypoxemia. 
Patient was transferred to floor after weaned down on O2 and off 
of pressors. She continued diuresis on the floor and continued 
to improve. She was discharged to rehab. 

ACUTE ISSUES:  
=============
# PEA Arrest. On the morning o ___, patient collapsed in bed. 
CODE BLUE called for PEA arrest. ROSC was obtained after ___ min 
of CPR and 1 round of epi. Etiology of cardiac arrest was 
thought likely secondary to worsening pulmonary hypertension and 
flash pulmonary edema. She was transferred to the unit for 
pressure support and aggressive diuresis. She was significantly 
improved on discharge.   

# Pulmonary HTN. After PEA arrest, repeat TTE demonstrated 
increased dilation of RV cavity with severe global free wall 
hypokinesis progressed from prior TTE. Pulmonary consult was 
obtained. She was started on epoprostenol, which was then 
weaned. She had PA catheter placed for directed therapy. She was 
started on Sidenafil, increased to 20mg TID. She did well with 
diuresis and was discharged on 20mg Sildenafil and daily PO 
Lasix.   

# Hypoxemia. Following PEA arrest, patient was persistently 
hypoxic requiring high flow nasal canuala. CTA was negative for 
PE but was concerning for flash pulm edema vs ?pulm hemorrhage. 
There was consideration of steroids to treat empiric for 
possible inflammatory process, but this was deferred given prior 
scleroderma renal crisis and high risk of recurrence. She was 
managed with BIPAP then transitioned to high flow nasal canula, 
which was eventually able to be weaned to nasal canula and 
transferred to the floor. Her respiratory status continued to 
improve with aggressive diuresis prior to discharge.  She had 
decreased ___ of NC on discharge. She will continue to need 
diuresis as tolerated and continued weaning of O2. 

# Shock: hypotensive post arrest initially requiring epinephrine 
drip. Epinephrine was changed to levophed and dobutamine after 
she developed cool lower extremities and there was concern for 
developing cyanosis. Hypotension likely cardiogenic due to right 
sided failure given no evidence of infection. Dobutamine was 
stopped but she intermittently required levophed throughout her 
ICU stay. With optimization of her pulmonary hypertension and 
volume status, she was weaned off of pressors and transferred to 
the floor. She did well from a BP stand point. She was 
hypotensive on ___ due to aggressive diuresis which improved 
with 500cc of oral water intake. BP had dropped to ___ and 
improved to 100s systolics. 

# ___: creatinine 2.9 on admission, down from 5s at OSH after 
blood and fluid resuscitation. She was then thought to be 
acutely volume overloaded. She was diuresed and creatnine had 
improved to 1.1 by time of discharge.

# Factor V Leiden-Heterogenous: Patient has a hx of DVT. CTA was 
obtained post arrest and was negative for PE. Repeat LENIs 
negative. Anticoagulation was initially held for question of a 
possible hemorrhage, however she remained stable and was 
re-started on anticoagulation with apixaban 5mg BID.    
  
# CREST syndrome: followed by rheumatology here. Seen by 
rheumatology, who recommended avoiding all steroids given high 
risk of recurrent scleroderma renal crisis. Patient reported 
that she has not taken steroids for more than ___ years. 
  
# Anemia: s/p 2 units PRBCs at OSH, per d/c summary HCt has 
remained stable. Multiple stool guaiacs have been positive. Iron 
studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease. The patient 
required 1u PRBCs during her stay and she responded 
appropriately. Her hemoglobin otherwise remained stable 
throughout hospital course. She will need outpatient follow up 
for her anemia. 

# UTI: pan-sensitive E.coli growing at OSH s/p 3 day course of 
CTX (___).  

# C-DIFF Diarrhea: Patient developed c-diff positive diarrhea. 
She was started on Vancomycin PO on ___. The vancomycin course 
was prolonged after a concern for a UTI on ___ with two days of 
ceftriaxone. Her diarrhea has improved. She will continue the PO 
vancomycin until ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on ___ 
for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain.  Admission 
abdominal/pelvic CT revealed an inflamed and thickened appendix. 
  There was extensive stranding with small amount of fluid 
surrounding the whole length of the appendix. WBC was within 
normal limits. The patient underwent laparoscopic appendectomy,  
without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for 
details). JP drain was placed during surgery. After a brief, 
uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor 
with IV fluids infusing and IV dilaudid for pain relief. The 
patient was hemodynamically stable.

When tolerating a diet, the patient was converted to oral pain 
medication with continued good effect. Diet was progressively

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old female with IgG Kappa
Multiple Myeloma presenting for autologous stem cell transplant.
Her oncologic history dates back to ___ and she had been
followed by Dr. ___ MGUS and mild thrombocytopenia. In
___ she developed a right femoral pathologic fracture
consistent with plasmacyoma. She underwent femur fixation on
___ at ___. She was then referred to the ___ 
___
clinic at ___ for further management. 

Her initial work-up on ___ was notable for the following: On
protein electrophoresis, there was an abnormal band in the gamma
region, representing 23.3% of the total protein, or 1840mg/dL.
When subjected to Immunofixation electrophoresis, this band is
identified as monoclonal IgG kappa. Free Kappa concentration is
400.6mg/L.  Total IgG concentration is 2391mg/dL. Her CBC
demonstrated a normal WBC, anemia with her Hgb at 8.4, and
platelets 395. Calcium was WNL and Beta ___ Micro was elevated at
2.6. Her albumin was 3.7. Her kidney function was normal with a
creatinine of 0.9. On urine protein electrophoresis trace 
albumin
was the only protein detected. A Skeletal Survey done showed
evidence of multiple osteolytic lesions in the calvarium and
lucencies in the mid to distal left femoral diaphysis are
nonspecific, small osteolytic lesion are not excluded. 
A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was done on ___ which
showed ___ highlights plasma cells comprising ___ of the
overall core biopsy cellularity and aspirate with plasma cells
representing 21%. Cytogentics show a normal female karyotype.
FISH was positive for gain of chromosomes 5,9 and 15. Given this

She has most recently completed 20 doses of daratumumab and has
had a VGPR with BM bx ___ showing 1% plasma cells. She then
presented for HD Cytoxan mobilization ___ to be followed by
autologous stem cell transplant. This was delayed due to FN and
prolonged TCP, BM bx ___ shown no evidence of myeloma and
thought this was related to presumed viral infection. Plt count
has improved and she now presents for autologous stem cell
transplant.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospitalization Summary (ED Admit)
The patient presented to the emergency department and was 
evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found 
to have large L4-5 disc herniation and was admitted to the 
orthopedic spine surgery service. The patient was taken to the 
operating room on ___ for revision lumbar disc decompression and 
fusion, which the patient tolerated well. For full details of 
the procedure please see the separately dictated operative 
report. The patient was taken from the OR to the PACU in stable 
condition and after satisfactory recovery from anesthesia was 
transferred to the floor. The patient was initially given IV 
fluids and IV pain medications, and progressed to a regular diet 
and oral medications by POD#1. The patient was given 
___ antibiotics and anticoagulation per routine. The 
patient's home medications were continued throughout this 
hospitalization. The patient worked with ___ who determined that 
discharge to home was appropriate. The ___ hospital course 
was otherwise unremarkable.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the 
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient 
will follow up with Dr. ___ routine. A thorough 
discussion was had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and 
expected post-discharge course including reasons to call the 
office or return to the hospital, and all questions were 
answered. The patient was also given written instructions

Imaging:

___ CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval increase in right pleural 
effusion, now large with apical component, and increased right 
middle and lower lobe consolidation, which is likely 
atelectasis, though concurrent infection is also possible. 
___ US: IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the left portal vein 
due to difficulty with patient positioning.  No evidence for 
portal vein thrombosis. Patent TIPS. New splenomegaly, now 
measuring 14.2 cm, previously 12 cm. Large right pleural 
effusion. 
___ CXR: IMPRESSION: Large right pleural effusion with near 
complete opacification of the right hemithorax. New pulmonary 
edema as seen within the left lung.
___ CXR: IMPRESSION: Right lung collapse and probable large 
right pleural effusion, unchanged from chest radiograph ___. Mild left-sided pulmonary edema is improved. 
___ Echo: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 
___, pulmonary artery pressure and tricuspid regurgitation 
are both greatly increased.
___ CXR: IMPRESSION: Significant interval decrease in the size 
of the large right pleural effusion with improved aeration of 
the right lung.  There is a small right pneumothorax. Interval 
increase in pulmonary edema. New left-sided pleural effusion. 
___ CT Chest: Large nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion, and 
small pleural air collection, present despite new right basal 
pleural drainage catheter could be substantially loculated, and 
is responsible for large scale atelectasis right middle and 
lower lobes.  Moderate left pleural effusion is layering, 
producing basal atelectasis. Possible pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. Severe intramuscular severe perimuscular anasarca 
is new. Abnormal bone texture could be due to metabolic bone 
disease.  Consider also metastases or myeloma.  Healing 
anterolateral fractures left middle ribs do not look pathologic. 

___ CT Abdomen/Pelvis: No acute process in the abdomen or 
pelvis to account for the patient's symptoms. Cirrhosis with 
TIPS stent. Splenomegaly. Please refer to separate chest CT 
report for details of intrathoracic findings.
___ CXR: Heart size is enlarged.  There is slight decrease in 
the loculated right-sided pleural effusion.  The left-sided 
pleural effusion is also improved. There remains mild pulmonary 
edema and atelectasis at the lung bases.
___ CXR: There is a new right-sided PICC line with the distal 
lead tip in the proximal right atrium.  This could be pulled 
back 2 cm to be at the cavoatrial junction.  There are low lung 
volumes.  There is unchanged pulmonary vascular congestion.  
There is a partially loculated right-sided pleural effusion, 
stable.  There are no pneumothoraces.
___ CXR: Right PICC line tip is at the level of low 
SVC/cavoatrial junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is 
unchanged including cardiomegaly.  There is interval progression 
of pulmonary edema and multifocal opacities concerning for 
progression of pulmonary edema and infection. Right pleural 
effusion is loculated, moderate, unchanged.
___ CXR: In comparison with the study of ___, there are 
slightly improved lung volumes.  Right PICC line again extends 
to about the level of the cavoatrial junction cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is unchanged, as are the bilateral pulmonary 
opacifications.  Moderate partially loculated right pleural 
effusion.
___ CXR: Right PICC line tip is in the right atrium, should be 
pulled back at least 3 cm.  Cardiomegaly is severe.  Pulmonary 
edema is severe. Multifocal consolidations are progressing.  
Pigtail catheter is in place with still present loculated right 
pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
___ CXR: Cardiac enlargement, pulmonary vascular congestion.  
Pulmonary edema, minimally improved.  Pleural effusions.  
Suggestion of small volume air in the right costophrenic angle 
adjacent to the right pleural catheter.
___ CT Chest: Probable left upper lobe pneumonia, increased 
since ___.  Probably responsible for new mild mediastinal 
and probable hilar adenopathy. No appreciable change in 
multiloculated moderate to large right hydro pneumothoraces, 
despite indwelling basal pleural drainage catheter. No change 
moderate dependent left pleural effusion.  Persistent pleural 
effusion and pleural thickening probably responsible for 
substantial bilateral atelectasis. Interval increase in 
pulmonary artery size suggests concurrent increase in pulmonary 
arterial pressure. Mild anasarca has increase. 

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST (___):
1. Resolved left pleural effusion and improved loculated right 
hydropneumothorax, including smaller right basilar component and 
resolved air within the anterior loculation. 
2. New right chest tube with tip and side-port looping in the 
basilar 
hydrothorax, however the tip lies along the lateral pleura, and 
not within the greatest amount of fluid which is located 
dependently. 
3. Significant re-expansion of bilateral upper and lower lobes, 
with mild residual compressive atelectasis remaining on the 
right. 
4. Improved reactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST (___):  
1. A central venous catheter tip is located within the inferior 
right atrium, 
essentially at the inferior cavoatrial junction. 
2. A loculated anterior right pleural effusion and associated 
compressive 
atelectasis are decreased. 
3. A dependent right pleural effusion is unchanged, compressive 
atelectasis 
slightly increased. 
4. Severe coronary atherosclerosis. 
5. Moderate aortic valve calcification.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with PMH NASH cirrhosis ___ year status post TIPS, whose 
cirrhosis is c/b banded varices, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic 
hydrothorax), diverticulitis, GERD, who presented with GI 
bleeding, sepsis and empyema. 

Pt initially required MICU level of care for stability of his 
blood loss as well as newly-developing respiratory failure. His 
respiratory failure was found to be from a right-sided empyema 
requiring chest tube. The patient was started on Ceftrixone for 
antibiotics, eventually transitioned to a prolonged course of 
augmentin (final dose through ___.

The patient had evidence of ___ as well as sepsis while in 
the MICU; the ___ thought to be multifactorial from infection in 
the setting of liver disease. He required two sessions of HD. He 
was given albumin and midodrine, to some response. When his 
respiratory status and oxygenation were stable, he was 
called-out to the floor. 

While on the floor, underwent exchange of chest tube- pleurx 
catheter was placed. Pt was diuresed with iV diuretics. when he 
was more euvolemic, he was transitioned to PO furosemide for his 
diuretic regimen. His oxygen requirement resolved after 
achievement of euvolemia. On ___, Pt underwent a repeat CT 
scan to assess for stability of his effusions. This scan 
demonstrated interval improvement. Given the decreasing amounts 
of daily drainage that Pt had from his tube, as well as 
improvement of the empyema, the Interventional Pulmonary team 
pulled his chest tube. He was discharged with close follow-up 
with his hepatologist and the Interventional Pulmonary team. Abx 
were to be continued for 1 week following CT removal.

with pleural fluid studies concerning for spontaneous bacterial 
empyema vs. infected hepatic hydrothorax. Pt underwent chest 
tube placement with eventual exchange to PleurX catheter when 
the drainage decreased. His chest tube drainage appeared 
transiently bloody but had a hematocrit of < 10, so no further 
angiographic studies obtained. Initially covered with 
ceftriaxone, then transitioned to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 
for a prolonged course (___). After downsizing to R TPC, 
Pt's PleurX had progressively decreasing fluid amounts with 
daily drainage. A CT scan on ___ demonstrated improvement of his 
hydrothorax, and per discussion with Interventional Pulmonary 
the tube was removed on ___. 
- After completion of his amox-clav (through ___, Pt should 
start ciprofloxacin 500mg q24h for SBP prophylaxis. 

# Acute-on-chronic anemia: 
Had one episode of hematemesis prior to arrival. No further 
evidence of this during hospitalization. No EGD performed. 
Without significant blood loss from his chest tube placement. 
Transiently downtrended and required a total of 4uPRBC for his 
entire hospital course. Thought to be a combination of 
phlebotomy, malnutrition, and depressed marrow response. His Hb 
stable for numerous days at discharge.

# Acute Oliguric Renal Failure ___ ATN
# Volume overload: 
With creatinine to a peak of 5.1. Thought to be due to a 
combination of prerenal insult -> ATN as well as volume 
overload. Pt briefly required two sessions of hemodialysis due 
to oliguria, but as his urine output improved and his creatinine 
downtrended his dialysis was discontinued. A tunneled subclavian 
dialysis catheter also removed at this time. For volume 
overload, Pt initially required BID IV furosemide diuresis; this 
was transitioned to 40mg PO furosemide and 50mg spironolactone 
daily when more euvolemic. He was without oxygen requirement at 
discharge, and his discharge creatinine was 0.9.
- Prescribed additional daily supplementation with 20mEq K and 
400mg mag oxide BID given ongoing electrolyte losses.

# Hypoxia:
# Fluid overload/Pulmonary Edema: 
In the setting of infected hepatic hydrothorax, as well as 
volume overload as above. Improved to room air after treatment 
of infection, daily drainage through TPC, and IV diuresis. He 
was maintained on PO furosemide and spironolactone at discharge, 
with electrolyte supplementation as above.

#Sepsis/hypotension 
BP low at baseline given ESLD. Initially required midodrine in 
the setting of acute kidney injury; this was decreased to 2.5mg 
TID and then discontinued upon discharge. BP improved with 
control of infection.

# NASH Cirrhosis c/b varices, HE, hepatic hydrothorax s/p TIPS: 
Pt was on transplant list, activated during the acuity of his 
illness. MELD-Na 25 at admission with subsequent peak of 40, now 
improving with above measures.
- Home PO vitamin K
- Home rifaximin and lactulose
- Augmentin as above for active infection

# GERD: 
- Home PPI

# Cough 
- Tessalon pearls 

# T2DM: 
- Given insulin sliding scale while at home. 
- Transitional issue to give dietary counseling and consider 
metformin at home, given blood sugars in the high 100-200 range 
while in-house.

# Left shoulder pain: 
Chronic and worse with use. Resolved today. MSK vs visceral 
though MSK more likely. 
- Given acetaminophen PRN

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at the ___ 
___.  

You were seen in our hospital because you were having worsening 
leg swelling, nausea, and vomiting blood.  Based on your imaging 
and other blood tests, we found that you had a bad infection 
from some fluid that built up around your lung.  You initially 
went to our Intensive Care Unit, where we gave you fluids and 
medicines to keep your blood pressure up.  You also had a tube 
placed in your right chest to help remove some of that infected 
fluid, which helped with your trouble breathing.  We continued 
to treat the infection with antibiotics and drain of the 
infected fluid.  When the infected fluid stopped accumulating, 
we were able to remove the drain in your chest.

Your kidneys also began to show evidence of damage during this 
time.  We thought this was due to your ongoing infection, as 
well as having a lot of fluid in your legs and lungs.  We gave 
you medicines to help get rid of this water, as well as treating 
your infection.  These helped your kidneys return to normal 
functioning levels.

Because you were so sick, you were put on the liver transplant 
list again.  Please talk to your liver doctor to find out what 
the next steps are in your transplant waiting time.

We did make some changes to your medications. We increased your 
furosemide and your spironolactone. You will also need to take 
an antibiotic called amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. This is for 
treatment of your lung infection. You should take this until 
___. On ___, you will need to start taking 
ciprofloxacin. This antibiotic will help to prevent further 
infections. We have also started you on metoclopramide to help 
with nausea. Only take this medication if you need it. We have 
also started you on magnesium oxide and potassium chloride to 
help with the salts in your blood. 

We wish you the best,
Your ___ Care Team

Nonocclusive thrombus of the right popliteal vein. 
===
CXR (___):   
Overall, the appearance of the lungs is similar compared to the 
prior study, with low lung volumes and areas of bilateral 
pulmonary opacity which may be due to mild edema superimposed on 
chronic lung disease.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are 
grossly stable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
=== 
Left knee plain film (___): 
There is severe narrowing of the medial compartment with 
osteophyte formation. Small patellofemoral joint osteophytes are 
also noted. There is patellar enthesopathy. There is a small 
joint effusion. The bones are demineralized. Chondrocalcinosis 
is appreciated.  There are vascular calcifications. No acute 
fracture or dislocation is noted.
=== 
Left hip plain film (___): 
The patient is status post open reduction internal fixation of 
an 
intertrochanteric left femur fracture.  As seen on the prior CT, 
there has 
been superior migration of the compression screw component of 
the dynamic hip screw which abuts the superior femoral cortex. 
There is persistent 
visualization of the intertrochanteric fracture with medial 
displacement of the mid lesser trochanter fragment.  Mild 
degenerative changes are noted at the bilateral hip joints.

HOSPITAL COURSE
====================
Ms. ___ ___ ___, with h/o asthma, angina, 
HFpEF (last Echo LVEF>55% on ___, DM, chronic DVT on 
warfarin, left breast mass s/p recision not on adjuvant therapy, 
?NSIP, s/p left fem fracture p/w bilateral L > R leg pain and 
edema, with new O2 requirement. 

The patient appeared to be volume overloaded on exam with new O2 
requirement. She was diuresed with 20mg IV Lasix ___ times per 
day (home dose 20mg PO QD), with resolution of oxygen 
requirement and decreased lower extremity edema. Discharge 
weight 154.1lb on ___.

The patient also had significant left knee and hip pain. Repeat 
XR showed screw migration, and orthopedics was consulted. Left 
hip arthrocentesis (___) was performed at their request, no 
sign of infection on culture. Ortho recommended repeat hip 
surgery for pain relief and better mobility, but patient and 
daughter declined; they will follow up with Dr. ___ in 
clinic. Pain controlled with Tylenol and occasional oxycodone.

====================
ACTIVE ISSUES
====================
# Dyspnea, likely secondary to acute on chronic diastolic heart 
failure. Patient initially reported increased dyspnea and 
orthopnea which she denied in subsequent interviews. Exam 
concerning for fluid overload (crackles, increased edema), 
weight on admission is up from 72kg in ___. Daily weights 
/ diuresis PRN 20mg IV Lasix; unreliable exam and I/Os, so goal 
was when back on room air (accomplished on ___, switched to 
home dose 20mg PO Lasix). Continued metoprolol 50mg daily. 
***Discharge weight: 69.9 kg. Discharge creatinine: 0.9***

# Recurrent bilateral lower extremity DVTs: Continued warfarin 
2mg daily, was held briefly for possible orthopedic surgery on 
___ and INR drifted down to 1.0 on discharge. Continuing 
warfarin 2mg daily on discharge with Lovenox bridge 60mg QD on 
discharge until therapeutic on warfarin. Stop Lovenox when INR 
is therapeutic (goal INR 2.0-3.0).

# Leg pain: Secondary to mechanical fall, though seems to be 
worsening. This may be due to increased swelling from heart 
failure. However, read of LENIs is unclear as to whether there 
could be worsening DVT. Pain may be consistent with worsening 
arthritis and/or neuropathy as well. Also, patient received 
steroid injection on ___ in left knee that may be wearing 
off. Seen by ortho last month with concern for ORIF screw 
migration with possible referred pain to knee. Ortho recommended 
hip replacement but patient and daughter deferred.

====================
CHRONIC ISSUES
====================
# Asthma (see dyspnea above): Continued home montelukast, 
budesonide, and albuterol.
# DM: Continued home regimen.

Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you. You came to the hospital

were low. You were also having a lot of pain in your legs.

We found that you seemed fluid-overloaded from your heart 
failure, and gave you higher doses of Lasix to get rid of this 
fluid. This appeared to work, and at discharge you were 
breathing comfortably without oxygen.

You were seen by the orthopedic doctors here, who ___ that 
complications from your hip surgery may be causing your pain. 
They offered to do a repeat surgery, but you decided to wait and 
follow up with the surgeons outpatient on ___ at 
10:15 AM.

It was a privilege to care for you in the hospital, and we wish 
you all the best.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Health Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the inpatient Colorectal Surgery 
Serivce post-operatively/ His post-operative check was stable. 
He was given intravenous fluids for hydration.  On his diet was 
sips of fluids only given his extensive lysis of adhesions and  
two anastomoses. We continued intravenous hydration. On the 
morning os post-operative day one he was doing quite well. He 
tolerated a small amount of clear liquids. He was noted to be 
tremulous with ambulation. All vital signs were stable and he 
had no other symptoms. He reported he had previously had similar 
symptoms when given narcotic pain medication after joint 
replacement surgery. This was improved at rest. Reglan was 
discontinued as a precaution. The Foley catheter was removed at 
midline and he voided without issue. The following day, he was 
doing well in the morning however, in the late morning he 
reported having nausea and had one episode of emesis. 
Intravenous hydration was continued and he was NPO. He passed 
flatus. In the afternoon he was noted to be febrile to 101 and 
he reported feeling week. OK dressing was taken down and the 
incision was intact. He was rigorous. He moved his bowels, his 
stool was black. EKG showed sinus tachycardia, cardiac enzymes 
were sent as a precaution and were negative. His urinalysis was 
negative.  He had acute onset of abdominal pain and was feeling 
unwell. He was evaluated by the chief resident and surgical 
attending. Broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was started out of 
concern for a leak. No leak or small bowel injury was found in 
the operating room. Howervern he did have very distended loops 
of small ___ and a nasogastric tube was left in place. A JP 
drain was left in place. Postoperatively the patient had a fever 
to 102.5, repeat chest film showed NG tube tip as in the stomach 
and interval increase in perihilar and basal opacities, 
concerning for interval 
aspiration or potentially increase in pleural effusion.  
Pneumonia was seen as unlikely. Over the next few days, he began 
to improve. The nasogastric tube was removed and the antibiotic 
therapy was transitioned to oral antibiotics. He was then 
tolerating a regular diet. He was discharged home on ___.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a Extensive lysis of 
adhesions and ileocolectomy for surgical management of your 
Crohns Disease. Unfortunately after surgery you became acutely 
sick and you were taking to the operating room again for an 
exploratory laparotomy to be sure nothing was leaking from the 
surgery however this was negative. You have recovered from this 
procedure well and you are now ready to return home. Samples 
from your bowel were taken and this tissue has been sent to the 
pathology department for analysis. You will receive these 
pathology results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an 
urgent need for the surgeon to contact you regarding these 
results they will contact you before this time. You have 
tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is 
controlled with pain medications by mouth. You may return home 
to finish your recovery. You will need to continue to take the 
antibiotic Amoxicillin  until ___. This is treating a 
pneumonia. 
 
Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is 
acceptable, however it is important that you have a bowel 
movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not 
uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function 
but you should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool 
and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are 
expected. However, if you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movements or having loose stool without 
improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room 
if the symptoms are severe. If you are taking narcotic pain 
medications there is a risk that you will have some 
constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener 
such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the 
office. If you have any of the following symptoms please call 
the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: 
increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, 
prolonged loose stool, or extended constipation.  
 
You have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed 
with staples and a VAC suction dressing. The staples will stay 
in place until your first post-operative visit at which time 
they can be removed in the clinic, most likely by the office 
nurse. THe VAC dressing should be removed every three days. The 
VAC dressing should always be to suction. If the VAC machiene is 
alarming please call the visiting nurses and our office. Please 
monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the 
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a 
fever. Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or 
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. You may 
shower, let the warm water run over the incision line and pat 
the area dry with a towel, do not rub. The visiting nurses ___ 
change the VAC dressing.   
 
No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless 
instructed otherwise by your surgical team. You may gradually 
increase your activity as tolerated but clear heavy exercise 
with your surgical team.  
 
You may take Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take 
more than 4000mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while 
taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive 
a car while taking narcotic pain medication.  
 
Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope 
is that you will have a quick return to your life and usual
