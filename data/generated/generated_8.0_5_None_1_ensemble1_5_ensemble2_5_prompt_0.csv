nausea/vomiting in two separate episodes. Seen by nutrition who 
recommended 8 Ensure per day.

[]Transplant workup (deferred):
To see Dr. ___ in the ___ clinic for f/u

SUMMARY:
============
___ man with EtOH Cirrhosis d/b ascites, esophageal varices
recurrent after banding, severe malnutrition, presents with
nausea/vomiting that resolved on admission.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#ETOH CIRRHOSIS d/b ascites, EV s/p banding with recurrence
Childs ___ C; MELD 30 on admission.
--VOLUME: last LVP ___ currently with mod ascites but
intravascularly dry; plan for LVP ___ + albumin; scheduled for 
outpatient
paracentesis ___
--HE: on lactulose for hx of mild asterixis; not on rifampin
--BLEEDING: grade I distal esophageal varices after banding
___ no e/o GIB at this time
--INFECTION: no hx of SBP; dx para in ED with 5 PMNs not c/w SBP
--Transplant: undergoing workup now, not yet listed (see 
transitional issues
for what is left in workup)
- NUTRITION: ___ placed on recent admission was not replaced 
due to
patient preference; he was seen by nutrition who recommended 8 
ensures/day and high caloire

#Discharge against medical recommendation
Given patient's severe protein calorie malnutrition, a 
nasogastric tube would be the optimal goal to maximize his 
nutritional status prior to possible liver transplant. This was 
explained to the patient however he declined an NG tube since he 
said he had not tolerated it twice now. He was seen by nutrition 
with recs for high calorie intake. At the time of discharge, the 
medical team (Hepatology attending and residents) explained to 
Mr ___ that nutritional optimization was integral to a 
successful liver transplant and that they recommended remaining 
in the hospital to ensure that he was able to take in enough 
calories by mouth. Mr ___ stated that he did not feel the 
hospital was doing anything for him and did not wish to stay 
here. He was agreeable to increasing his food intake and 
endorsed that he would try to drink 8 ensures per day. The 
medical team also explained that compliance was an important 
aspect of liver transplant candidacy and that it would be 
important in the future to be in the hospital, even if felt 
well. The patient stated understanding of this and still wished 
to leave as he felt he did not have much time to live and did 
not want to spend it in the hospital.

#Nausea/vomiting
Patient attributes n/v to ___. Currently asymptomatic
- therapeutic para plan for ___
- IV ondansetron PRN Q8 if QTc <500

#Hyponatremia
Na 126 on admit from recent baseline of 130-132. Likely
hypovolemic i/s/o nausea and vomiting, with urine Na <20.
Superimposed on worsening cirrhotic physiology. Not currently on
diuretics given his refractory ascites. While Cr is normal this
is probably under-estimated given his sarcopenia. He was given
albumin with improvement.

#Severe protein calorie malnutrition
Pt had ___ placed last admission and did not tolerate the
tube. continued folic acid, thiamine, vitamin D. Nutrition
consulted and #############

CHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES:

Brief Hospital Course:
PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION:

___ PMH DDRT (membranous glomerulonephritis ___, R DCIS s/p 
lumpectomy (___), now metastatic PDAC on daGramont, PVT on 
rivaroxaban, R pleural effusion, who presents from clinic with 
___ days of worsening orthopnea and DOE, found to have 
reaccumulating pleural effusion. Right chest tube placed on ___ 
with persistent copious chylous fluid. We started octreotide 
100mg tid and she is on a low fat diet. TPC was placed on ___ 
and we DC'd octreotide on ___. We drained 500cc from TPC on 
___.

Course notable for mild hypotension and acute on chronic kidney 
injury. Likely combination of hypovolemia  from large volume 
chest tube output and possibly contrast induced nephropathy. We  
DC'd her metoprolol provided IVF and 1 unit pRBC on ___. Her 
creatinine has improved back to its baseline, however will 
continue to hold her rivaroxabon until outpatient follow up as 
her creatinine clearance is still very close to 30. 
 
Otherwise, she was deconditioned and had nausea, vomiting and
constipation. She received aggressive bowel regimen and 
eventually developed diarrhea due to laxative use. Her symptoms 
improved significantly and she was seen multiple times by ___ and 
clear for home discharge with services.  

# Orthopnea
# Chylothorax: Admitted from clinic after noted to have 
signficant orthopnea and DOE. Imaging found reaccumulation of 
right pleural effusion.  Right chest tube placed on ___ with 
persistent copious chylous fluid. We started octreotide 100mg 
tid and she is on a low fat diet. TPC was placed on ___ and we 
DC'd octreotide on ___. We drained 500cc from TPC on ___. 
Pleural fluid cytology was negative for malignancy and no growth 
to date on pleural fluid cultures. Should continue to drain TPC 
weekly or as needed. She should continue low fat diet high in 
medium chain triglyceride diet, and she was evaluated by 
nutrition. Please note we held her lasix this admission. 

# Membranous glomerulonephritis s/p DDRT (___).
# Acute on chronic kidney injury 
Followed by Dr ___. Cr increased in setting of dehydration 
due to large volume losses from chylothorax. Likely exacerbated 
by CIN post contrast. She received aggressive fluid resucitation 
with IVF and 1 unit pRBC. Creatinine returned to baseline on 
discharge. We continued cyclosporine and prednisone QOD. 

# PVT on rivaroxaban: Last took her Xarelto ___ at 7 pm. 
Initially held in preparation for thoracentesis. Later continued 
holding in setting of chronic kidney disease. ___ consider 
resuming as outpatient if eGFR remains stable.

# Metastatic pancreatic cancer on daGramont (last given D2D15
___. 
# Chemotherapy induced neuropathy
# Chemotherapy induced nausea
Diagnosed in early ___ and thought to be locally advanced.
Treated with 5 cycles of ___.
Course was complicated by cholangitis ___. Repeat imaging in
___ raised concern for metastatic progression (peritoneal
thickening, large pleural effusion). Started on daGramont
protocol ___. Neulasta given ___ in clinic. ___ injector
removed. She was scheduled for repeat staging on ___ received 
on ___ as
inpatient - scans showed some increased peritoneal thickening, 
otherwise
stable. She developed signficant nasuea and vomiting several 
days after chemotherapy in the setting ___ and ___ from 
chest tube. We provided PRN Zofran, Compazine, and Ativan. We 
also continued creon 1 tab for snacks, 2 for meals. For 
abdominal discomfort we used tramadol PRN and simethicone PRN. 
We also continued acyclovir and Bactrim for ppx.

# Constipation: 
# Diarrhea: Patient with no BM for several days after admission, 
likely
exacerbated by octreotide. She was provided with aggressive 
bowel regimen. Subsequently developed several episodes of liquid 
stool, thought due to laxative effect. She should continue 
Colace BID along with Miralax, Bisacodyl and senna prn.

# Chronic macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia: Chronic issue 
exacerbated by chemotherapy. SP 1 unit pRBC on ___ with good 
bump. Unclear why she has such a macrocytosis. B12 and folate 
normal. Heme path reviewed PBS without evidence of 
abnormalities.

# Leukocytosis: Developed profound leukocytosis in setting of 
Neulasta. Subeequently downtrended during stay. No clear signs 
of infection.

# IDDM: Reduced lantus to 4 u qHS and low dose sliding scale due 
to low sugars and poor po intake. Sugars later increased and she 
was raised to 6 units lantus; still significantly lower than her 
home does. 

# HTN: We initially fractionated to home metoprolol to 50 mg 
tartrate BID. When patient devleoped soft blood pressures and 
___ we held the medication.

# Oral thrush: Resolved after 7 day course of clotrimazole.

# Hx of abdominal abscess: 
Secondary to retained stones and biloma. She continues to have 
biliary drain in place; plan to keep in place indefinitely. We 
continued suppressive Bactrim (per ID)

# Billing: >30 minutes spent coordinating this discharge plan

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- STOPPED: Lasix, metoprolol, rivaroxaban
- Consider restarting rivaroxaban if kidney function remains 
stable with eGFR>30
- Follow up final pleural fluid culture

Chief Complaint:
Lumbar spinal stenosis
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ - Bilateral L3/4 and L4/5 laminectomy with 
non-instrumented fusion
 
History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ female who presents today
with two or ___ years history of back and radiating buttock 
and
thigh pain, provoked by standing and walking, characteristic of
neurogenic claudication.

She characterizes this pain as a sharp pain, as well as an
occasionally lightning or shooting type of pain.  It is
precipitated by walking, reaching, standing, bending, and
lifting.

She has a long history of prior lumbar spinal disorders.  At age
___, she underwent L5-S1 decompression and fusion, for treatment
of what may have been instability.

More recently, however, she has developed this  claudicatory leg
symptoms.  It interfere with her ability to stand and walk
significantly.  For that reason, she did seek care at ___, and saw Dr. ___.  She did recognize that
she had severe lumbar spinal stenosis at two segments, above her
fusion, L3-L4 and L4-L5, and for that reason, was started a
course of conservative care.

She had physical therapies, as well as medications.  These
interventions did not help her significantly, and for that
reason, Dr. ___ suggested that she see Dr. ___
to be considered a candidate for epidural steroid treatments. 
These epidurals could not be performed, because the patient has 
a
prior history of allergy to prednisone.

She explains to me that when she had prednisone in the past, she
developed facial swelling, as well as some tightness in her 
neck.
 For that reason, the prednisone is felt to be an allergy for
her.

In the setting of severe stenosis, significant claudicatory
symptoms, and no significant improvement in her ability to stand
and walk with conservative care, it was suggested that she see 
me
today to be considered a candidate for surgical decompression.

FINDINGS:  
There is mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement without 
overt pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There 
is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette size 
is mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by AP technique.  
Mediastinum is unremarkable.  The aorta is somewhat 
tortuous. 

TTE Echo ___
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately 
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a 
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic 
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with 
the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the degree of 
MR seen has increased.  
  
IMPRESSION:  
Mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt 
pulmonary edema.  Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette size, 
likely accentuated by AP technique. 

Chest Xray ___
In comparison with study ___, the cardiac silhouette 
remains mildly

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y M with hx of HTN, HLD, and LVH admitted from PCP 
appointment for complete heart block in the setting of new onset 
fatigue, lightheadedness, palpitations, DOE, and bradycardia. 

Acute medical issues:

# COMPLETE HEART BLOCK. 
The patient was admitted for symptomatic bradycardia without 
syncope, and was found to be in complete heart block. He did not 
have a prior history of cardiac conduction abnormalities. The 
likely etiology is Lyme disease, as Lyme antibodies returned 
positive. Other causes that were considered were Herpes Zoster, 
infiltrative process, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and thyroid 
disorder. TSH and T4 were within normal limits. EP was consulted 
with plan for pacemaker placement pending Lyme antibodies. 
However, Lyme antibodies returned positive, so no pacemaker was 
placed, and patient was started on ceftriaxone 2g IV q24h for 
planned 3 week course (end ___. TTE was performed and 
showed ejection fraction >55%. 

Chronic issues pertinent to admission:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care here at 
___.

Why was I taken to the hospital?
You were admitted for a slow heart rate called heart block. You 
were monitored in the intensive care unit. The cause of your 
slow heart rate was mostly likely Lyme disease and therefore 
your heart rate should improve with treatment of your Lyme 
disease. For this reason, you did not have a pacemaker placed. 

What happened while I was at the hospital?
You were given antibiotics to treat Lyme disease and we 
performed tests to monitor your heart function and electrical 
activity.

What do I do when I leave the hospital?
-Please take your antibiotics and medications as prescribed. You 
will need antibiotics for three weeks to treat Lyme, ending 
___.
-Please make sure you see electrophysiology (EP) for follow up 
in 1 month (approx. ___ - see information below.  
-We have arranged infectious disease follow up for you but you 
may return to ___ without ID follow up if this is your 
preference.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC w(ALK-rearranged) p/w
shoulder pain, found to rapid disease progression, w/ large RUL
cavitating carcinoma, massive encapsulated subpulmonic 
collection
displacing the mediastinum, liver, IVC causing R. hepatic vein
thrombosis, pleural dissemination, bony mets, and pericardial
effusion. 

# Large Pleural Effusion
Impressively considering the extent of the size, he is
asymptomatic apart from R shoulder pain, which is most likely
referred phrenic pain and remarkably 97-99% on RA. IP and CT 
have
evaluated patient and he had a CT placed on ___ w/ over 5L of 
dark ___ 
colored viscous fluid removed within first 12 hours, and over 7 
liters
over his hospitalization, requiring TPA/DNAse several times. 
Studies c/w exudate. Chest tube was removed on ___ w/ CXR post 
CT removal a new PTX
but this is a pneumothorax ex vacuo and he was asymptomatic. His 
O2 sats
remained high ___ on room air. ___ did an extra thoracetnesis on 
___ before
discharge to help remove fluid from an anterior pocket. He will 
see them in clinic
for follow up. 

# Pericardial Effusion
This was incidentally  noted on CT chest. It was measured 13 mm
on admission CT. Tachycardic and soft blood pressures here. EKG
revealed low voltage. TTE revealed moderate effusion w/o
tamponade. Repeat TTE after pleural fluid drained on ___
revealed mild to moderate, so largely stable if not better. This 
is likely seepage from
the massive pleural effusion that was causing a mediastinal 
shift, and also cannot 
rule out malignant effusion.
- will need serial TTEs as outpatient
- pt educated on tamponade symptoms

# NSCLC
He has been consented for ___ ___ (Crizotinib vs. 
Brigatinib
for advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC) on ___. 
- PO chemo scheduled as outpatient to start ___ 
- bisphosphonate as outpatient

# Constipation
This is opiate induced. Very fearful of this recurring. Resolved 
with ___ donuts
coffee and part of a chocolate donut.
- cont daily miralax, senna/colace, and started daily MOM

# ___: mild, likely SIADH related to pain, will monitor

# Anemia: likely inflammatory block from malignancy. TSH, Fe,

History of Present Illness:
___ y/o female with h/o sarcoid, HTN, and T2DM who presented with
facial numbness and found to have Ph+ ALL (normal cytogenetics)
with CNS involvement. She was initially treated with steroids 
and
desatinib. Once she achieved hematologic remission d/c home with
ongoing treatment. On bone marrow biopsy on D+ 23 consistent 
with
remission. Induction complicated by depression/anxiety, and
uncontrolled DM requiring insulin. HLA typing done without
matched unrelated donor found. TKI maintenance changed from
dasatinib to nolotinib 400mg BID when PCR became detectable and
developed recurrent pleural effusions and planned to start
blinatumomab. Most recent PCR undetectable. Initially was coming
for planned admission for blinatumomab, but given increase in
indirect bilirubin (known side effect of nolotinib) will hold 
TKI
for now and decide on blinatumomab moving forward.

Overall has been fatigued and has had mild rib pain that she
attributes to her pleural effusions, for which she has had
multiple thoracenteses. She did mention that she had abdominal
pain in the past that radiated to her chest area, which was
thought to be gallstones. Otherwise, she has mild SOB with
stairs, but can walk ~1 mile on flat ground. She also has a dry
cough, but denies fevers or chills. She also denies N/V/D/C.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on 
___ for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain and 
distention.  Admission abdominal/pelvic CT revealed cecal 
volvulus. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, 
ileocecectomy,
and lysis of adhesions, which went well without complication 
(reader referred to the Operative Note for details). After a 
brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the 
floor still NPO with a nasogastric tube, on IV fluids, and 
dilaudid PCA for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically 
stable.
.
Pain was well controlled. Once having bowel function, diet was 
progressively advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with good 
tolerability. The patient voided without problem. During this 
hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and frequently, was 
adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry, and 
actively participated in the plan of care. The patient received 
subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this 
stay.

On HD #6, she was noted to have erythema around the wound, 
staples from the mid-portion of the wound removed and a dry 
dressing applied. The patient was started on a 10 day course of 
Keflex.  Wound erythema has decreased.  At the time of 
discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable 
vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ with abdominal pain and were found on 
CT scan to have a cecal volvulus, which is when a part of the 
colon becomes twisted and causes a partial obstruction in the 
intestines. You were taken to the operating room and underwent 
an exploratory laparotomy, ileocecectomy, and lysis of 
adhesions. You tolerated the procedure well and are now being 
discharged home to continue your recovery with the following 
instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem

screening for ___ syndrome with MRI spine to look 
for spinal tumors and CT torso to evaluate for adrenal tumors; 
MRI spine and CT torso were both negative. Headaches were 
treated with fioricet and nausea was treated with reglan and 
zofran with good effect. The patient underwent cerebral 
angiogram on ___ for embolization of the cerebellar tumor. 
After the procedure the patient was noted to have a left lateral 
gaze preference, continued nystagmus, new bilateral dymetria, 
right pronator drift, nausea, blurred vision, and worsening 
headaches. A STAT NCHCT was ordered and she was transferred to 
the neuro ICU for close monitoring. CT head showed unchanged 
obstructive hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of CSF 
however given the patients worsened symptoms a right frontal EVD 
was placed. She was intubated for the procedure and given 
mannitol. EVD was lowered to 15. A MRI WAND study was performed 
prior to OR for posterior fossa craniotomy for resection of the 
lesion. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see

evening. Patient was given two 500cc boluses and IV metoprolol 
for persistent tachycardia with good effect. Patient passed a 
bedside swallow eval and was started on a regular diet. Her 
foley and A-line were removed. A post-op MRI showed expected 
post-op changes and possible recurrent residual tumor, follow-up 
imaging was recommened (patient has follow-up on ___. On

Discharge Instructions
Brain Tumor

Surgery
You underwent surgery to remove a brain lesion from your 
brain. 
Please keep your incision dry until your sutures/staples are 
removed. 
You may shower at this time but keep your incision dry.
It is best to keep your incision open to air but it is ok to 
cover it when outside. 
Call your surgeon if there are any signs of infection like 
redness, fever, or drainage. 

Activity
You may gradually return to your normal activities, but we 
recommend you take it easy to avoid bleeding from your groin.
Heavy lifting, running, climbing, or other strenuous exercise 
should be avoided for ten (10) days. This is to prevent bleeding 
from your groin.
You make take leisurely walks and slowly increase your 
activity at your own pace. ___ try to do too much all at once.
Do not go swimming or submerge yourself in water for five (5) 
days after your embolization procedure.
You make take a shower.
No driving while taking any narcotic or sedating medication. 
If you experienced a seizure while admitted, you are NOT 
allowed to drive by law. 
No contact sports until cleared by your neurosurgeon. You 
should avoid contact sports for 6 months. 

Medications
Please do NOT take any blood thinning medication (Aspirin, 
Ibuprofen, Plavix, Coumadin) until cleared by the neurosurgeon. 
You may use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for minor discomfort if 
you are not otherwise restricted from taking this medication.
You are being discharged on the end of your dexamethasone 
taper. Please complete this medication course as directed. You 
should take this medication consistently and on time. You should 
take famotidine while on this medication, and can discontinue 
the famotidine once the dexamethasone is finished. 

What You ___ Experience:
You may experience headaches and incisional pain. 
You may also experience some post-operative swelling around 
your face and eyes. This is normal after surgery and most 
noticeable on the second and third day of surgery.  You apply 
ice or a cool or warm washcloth to your eyes to help with the 
swelling. The swelling will be its worse in the morning after 
laying flat from sleeping but decrease when up. 
You may experience soreness with chewing. This is normal from 
the surgery and will improve with time. Softer foods may be 
easier during this time. 
Feeling more tired or restlessness is also common.
Constipation is common. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and 
eat a high-fiber diet. If you are taking narcotics (prescription 
pain medications), try an over-the-counter stool softener.

When to Call Your Doctor at ___ for:
Severe pain, swelling, redness or drainage from the incision 
site. 
Fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit
Nausea and/or vomiting
Extreme sleepiness and not being able to stay awake
Severe headaches not relieved by pain relievers
Seizures
Any new problems with your vision or ability to speak
Weakness or changes in sensation in your face, arms, or leg

Call ___ and go to the nearest Emergency Room if you experience 
any of the following:
Sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg
Sudden confusion or trouble speaking or understanding
Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or 
coordination
Sudden severe headaches with no known reason

IMAGING:
========
CXR ___:
1. Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions 
with associated bibasilar atelectasis.  However, superimposed 
pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
2. Possible mild pulmonary edema. 

CXR ___:
In comparison with the study of ___, the there are lower 
lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is a 
vague suggestion of opacification at the right base medially.  
This most likely represents atelectatic changes.  However, in 
the appropriate clinical setting, would be difficult to exclude 
superimposed aspiration/pneumonia. 

MRI brain ___:
1. Acute infarction of the left caudate body, putamen, and 
internal capsule.  No evidence of hemorrhage. 
2. Microangiopathic changes as described above. 

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is 
normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. 
The visually estimated leftventricular ejection fraction is 
>=60%.Left ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). 
There isno resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. 
Tissue Doppler suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP greater than 18mmHg). Normal right ventricular 
cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus 
diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta 
diameter for gender. There is a normal descending aorta 
diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
There is mild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral valve 
prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. 
There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal. No mass/vegetation are seen 
on the tricuspid valve. There is physiologic tricuspid 
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic 
regurgitation with normal leaflet morphology. No definite 
structural cardiac source of embolism identified.

___ CXR:
Heterogeneous opacification left lower lobe could be due to 
recent aspiration. Follow-up advised.  Right lung clear.  No 
pulmonary edema.  Heart borderline enlarged.  Concurrent CTA of 
the head and neck show that the large contour of the aortic knob 
is due to a combination of a tortuous aorta and mediastinal fat. 

  
ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric drainage tube passes 
into the stomach and out of view. 

___ CTA Head & Neck with Perfusion
Noncontrast CT head: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or 
evidence of subacute (i.e. Greater than 6 hours) large 
territorial infarction. Sequela of prior left-sided lacune in 
the internal capsule as well as multiple periventricular and 
subcortical deep white matter hypodensities are seen. 
Subcortical and deep white matter hypodensities are nonspecific, 
but likely represent sequela chronic microvascular ischemic 
disease.
 
CTA head and neck: In the right anterior cerebral artery, there 
is some evidence of caliber change (series 4; image 220), which 
may be due to tortuosity of the vessel. No definite high-grade 
stenosis or occlusion in this region. There is an approximately 
2 mm right-sided posterior communicating aneurysm (series 602; 
image 41, series 4; image 213). No additional high-grade 
stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm of the major vessels of the 
head and neck.
 
CT perfusion: CBF <30%: 0 cc; Tmax >6.0s: 175 cc; Mismatch: 
175cc. Perfusion data on rapid software shows limiting technical 
factors.

Brief Hospital Course:
for Outpatient Providers:
PATIENT SUMMARY:
================
This is a ___ woman with a history of hypertension and 
asthma who presented as a transfer from ___ with slurred 
speech, right facial droop, and sensory loss prompting tPA ___ 
at 16:00 subsequently found to have infarct of left caudate 
body, putamen, and internal capsule.

Patient initially presented with slurred speech, right facial 
droop and right hemiparesis and was found to have an acute left 
basal ganglia and internal capsule infarct and received tPA. 24H 
NIHSS was 8. Imaging was notable for edema and mass effect so 
she was treated with hypertonic saline initially. Exam was 
notable for right arm hemiparesis and right facial palsy with 
activation. Her risk factor labs were notable for A1c of 6.6 and 
LDL 155. She was started on sliding scale insulin, aspirin, and 
atorvastatin given the above. Home lisinopril was continued in 
house and amlodipine was added to her anti-hypertensive regimen. 
Etiology most likely small vessel secondary to uncontrolled risk 
factors.

There was initial concern regarding her respiratory status which 
lead to patient being intubated on arrival to ___. She was 
subsequently extubated but had ongoing issues with dysphagia and 
difficulty clearing secretions. Her hospital course was also 
complicated by klebsiella UTI for which she received a 7 day 
course of ciprofloxacin. 

She failed multiple swallow evaluations ultimately required a 
PEG. This was placed on ___. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
# Guaiac positive stool in ED, anemic this admission but stable. 
Will need monitoring outpatient, including possible colonoscopy.

# Patient should continue aspirin, atorvastatin and amlodipine 
in addition to lisinopril. 

# Consider oral medication for diabetes control. She had an 
elevated HgA1c of 6.6% on this admission (new diagnosis of 
diabetes)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,  

 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of slurred speech, right 
facial droop, and sensory loss resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC 
STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and 
nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the 
part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts 
of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its 
blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.  
 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
You also received a PEG tube because of concern that you could 
not swallow safely. Your stroke risk factors are:  
 
- Hypertension
- Diabetes 
- Hyperlipidemia 

We are changing your medications as follows:  

- Started atorvastatin 40 mg daily
- Started aspirin 81 mg daily
- Started amlodipine 10 mg daily 
  
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

Sincerely,  
Your ___ Neurology Team

___ IVC GRAM/FILTER ___ procedure)
FINDINGS:
1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with single bilateral 
renal veins
and no evidence of a clot.
2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC 
filter.

___ COLONOSCOPY 
Findings:
Excavated LesionsMultiple diverticula were seen in the entire 
colon. Diverticulosis appeared to be severe. There were no 
stigmata of bleeding. No blood was seen in the colon or examined 
terminal ileum. 
Impression:Diverticulosis of the entire colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and TI
Recommendations:No definitive source of bleeding localized. A 
diverticular source is likely, however.
Follow up with inpatient GI team.

___ ABDOMINAL AORTA ___ procedure) 
FINDINGS: 
Superior mesenteric venogram demonstrating the middle colic 
artery arising
approximately at a very acute angle.  No active extravasation of 
contrast is identified.
IMPRESSION: 
No active extravasation identified on superior mesenteric 
venogram though the vessel of interest based on CTA findings, 
the middle colic artery, was unable to be cannulated due to 
acute angulation at its origin and further
interrogation of this vessel could not be obtained.

___ CT A/P 
1. Focal active arterial extravasation into the transverse colon 
fed by a
branch from the SMA.
2. Asymmetric enlargement of the right common femoral vein with 
mild adjacent fatty stranding corresponds with known deep venous 
thrombosis as seen on recent ultrasound.  Similar appearance of 
the right external iliac vein which suggests involvement of this 
vein with thrombus as well.
3. Extensive diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
====================
BRIEF SUMMARY 
====================

Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of HIV (last CD4 396, 
___ on raltegravir/Truvada, diverticulosis, recent 
hospitalization for extensive RLE DVT and started on apixaban, 
who presented with large bright red blood per rectum, with 
active extravasation seen from SMA at the transverse colon on 
CTA. Interventional radiology attempted but was unable to 
intervene given patient's vascular anatomy. He was transfused 8U 
pRBC. He went to the MICU initially for hemorrhagic shock 
requiring pressors, and was transferred to floor once 
stablizied. Colonoscopy showed diverticuli but no bleeding. IVC 
filter was placed. He was stable without evidence of further 
bleeding, so he was started on lower dose apixaban 5 BID by 
discharge. 

=======================
PROBLEM-BASED SUMMARY
=======================

ACUTE ISSUES: 

#Lower GI Bleed
#Hemorrhagic shock 
He had multiple episodes of bright red blood per rectum with 
hemoglobin 12.5 on admission, compared to 14.4 on last discharge 
on ___. Given massive BRBPR (filling 3 bedpans), he was 
transfused 8U pRBC. Likely etiology is diverticular bleed of 
transverse colon in setting of recent initiation of apixaban for 
DVT. CTA showed transverse colonic bleed of SMA branch. 
Interventional radiology attempted but was unable to intervene 
upon the suspected vessel due to difficult anatomy. During the 
procedure there was no evidence of active bleed and he remained 
hemodynamically stable without more blood. He was admitted to 
the MICU initially for hemorrhagic shock requiring pressor 
support. He was procedurally intubated for ___ and extubated ___ 
without issues. Home apixaban 10 BID was held. Colonoscopy was 
performed ___, which did not show bleeding but did show many 
diverticuli. IVC filter was placed ___. He was stable and 
transferred to the floor, where apixaban for DVT treatment was 
restarted at a lower dose 5 BID. 

#RLE DVT
He was diagnosed with extensive RLE DVT during his last 
admission, extending from common femoral to the peroneal veins. 
He was started on apixaban ___. He was planned for follow up 
with vascular surgery 3 months after discharge. As above, IVC 
filter was placed on ___ while patient was not on 
anticoagulation in the setting of massive lower GI bleed. He 
will need to follow up with ___ in 4 weeks for removal of IVC 
filter. Apixaban was restarted by discharge at lower dose of 5 
BID. Beta-2-Glycoprotein 1 Antibodies and Cardiolipin Antibodies 
were negative. He has follow up scheduled with Hematology in 
___ clinic. 

___ 
Creatinine peaked this admission at 1.8, compared to baseline of 
1.0. ___ felt to be likely prerenal from hypovolemia, as it 
resolved after fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions. Home 
acyclovir and quinapril were restarted once creatinine improved. 
Discharge creatinine was 1.0. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 

#HIV: Diagnosed ___ with no history of AIDS defining illness. 
Regular follow up in ___ clinic, 100% compliance with meds. On 
Raltegravir 400mg PO BID and emtricitabine-tenofovir daily. Also 
takes dronabinol for appetite. 

#Hypertension: Home antihypertensives amlodipine and quinapril 
were restarted after patient stabilized and creatinine improved. 


#Soft tissues swelling: Soft tissue swelling was noted on 
___ on L lower back. Non painful. Ultrasound revealing 6cm 
deep fluid collection with echogenic debris. This was unlikely 
to be abscess given overall clinical presentation. 

#Oral HSV: Resumed home acyclovir once creatinine was improved 
by discharge. 

#Benign Essential Tremor: He was restarted on home propranolol 
60mg BID by discharge; initially held in setting of GIB. 

#GERD: Continued ranitidine 300mg daily (12 hours after HAART). 

#Allergies: Continued fluticasone nasal spray, fexofenadine 60mg 
daily. 

#Depression: Continued citalopram 40mg daily, mirtazaplin 45mg 
PO QHS, clonazepam 0.5mg BID.

#Skin Rash: Uses mupirocin, ketoconazole and silver sulfadiazine

#Testosterone replacement: On testosterone cypionate IM weekly. 
Transitional issue to discuss this with PCP as an outpatient. 
Consider potential contribution of testosterone to risk of 
clotting.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure to care for you at ___ 
___. Please find detailed discharge instructions 
below: 

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL? 
- You were admitted because you were bleeding from your gut, and 
stooling large amounts of bright red blood. 

WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU IN THE HOSPITAL? 
- We suspect you were bleeding from ""diverticuli"", which are 
outpouchings of the large intestine. 
- You were transfused 8 units of blood. 
- We held your apixaban (your blood thinner) initially because 
of your bleeding. 
- Interventional radiology tried to fix the suspected bleeding 
vessel, but they were unable to do so because of your vascular 
anatomy. 
- You were intubated (tube into your lungs to help you breathe)  
for the interventional radiology procedure, but you were quickly 
successfully extubated (tube was removed). 
- You went to the medical ICU initially because of the volume of 
your bleeding. You were transferred to the floor once the 
bleeding slowed.
- You received a colonoscopy, which did not show any active 
bleeding, but did show many diverticuli. 
- You had an IVC filter placed, to prevent the blood clot in 
your legs from traveling up to your lungs, while you were not 
taking the apixaban. 
- You did well and did not have further bleeding, so you were 
able to restart the apixaban at a lower dose to treat your DVT. 

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN  YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? 
- Please go to all your follow up appointments as scheduled. 
- Please take all your medications as prescribed. 
- Please be sure to follow up with interventional radiology for 
removal of the IVC filter in 4 weeks. They will reach out to you 
to schedule the filter removal. Their number is: ___. 
- Please get repeat bloodwork done on ___. 

We wish you the best! 
- Your ___ treatment team

Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Fall from standing
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Per patient, she was standing and drinking a cup of coffee. The 
next thing she remembers is ""falling to the ground""; she denies 
preceding symptoms including lightheadedness/dizziness, 
palpitations, shortness of breath. She thinks she ""blacked out"". 
She was transported to ___ ER, where evaluation was concerning 
for left frontal SDH and L wrist fracture, prompting transfer to 
___.  

 On transfer, she was evaluated by ___ who recommended 
non-operative management including continuation of her home 
keppra, holding anticoagulation, and ongoing monitoring. She was 
evaluated by Ortho who noted her L hip, which she had recently 
fractured, had a small surrounding hematoma and recommended she 
could be weight bearing as tolerated. They also evaluated her L 
wrist fracture and recommended casting as well as ongoing 
monitoring. Following stabilization of her acute injuries, the 
decision was made to transfer to Medicine for ongoing work-up of 
her syncope/fall.  
 
 Of note, patient has had x2 recent falls; the first was approx. 
2 months ago at home from standing and she was evaluated at 
___ where she was found to have fractured her 
collarbone. She spent x1 month in rehab, which per her family 
was very traumatic for her and she received little to no rehab 
and spent >20h/day in bed. She then went back home when she fell 
in the middle of the ___ and presented to ___, where she 
was noted to have a left hip fracture. Her hospital course at 
___ was complicated by anemia, thought to be ___ to iron 
deficiency, and she received 1u PRBC and was started on iron 
supplementation. She was again discharged to rehab. She was at 
home for x1 week prior to her recurrent fall.  

 Per patient's son, she is very stubborn and does not often 
listen to medical advice. For example, she has 16H/day care and 
is not supposed to walk around without them, however she 
continues to do so. He also reports that she often does not tell 
the truth regarding her medical history. He says they recently 
started seeing a new Neurologist at ___ (Dr. 
___, but she has not had any new medication changes. He 
reports that, due to her history of GIB, she did not receive 
anticoagulation following her recent fractures. The family has 
been discussing whether or not she is safe to return to her ALF, 
however are concerned about the mental burden of having her go 
back to rehab since her recent experience was so traumatic

Brief Hospital Course:
___ F with medical history notable for meningioma, ___ 
disease, dementia, recurrent falls w/recent admission to ___ for 
fall complicated by hip fracture (___) who presented to ___ on 
___ after a fall from standing transferred to ___ for 
management of L frontal temporal SDH (non-operable), L wrist 
fracture (non-operable). She was originally admitted to the 
surgery service, then transferred to medicine for further work 
up of her fall. The follow issues were addressed:

#S/p fall: Patient describes a mechanical-type fall from 
standing, although she has a history of possible seizures in the 
setting of her known meningioma vs worsening ataxia secondary to 
___. Orthostatic vital signs were negative. TTE, EEG 
were not obtained given low concern for cardiac or neurogenic 
syncope. Geriatrics was consulted for optimization of fall risk 
prior to discharge. They made several recommendations including: 
weaning Clonazepam, changing PPI to once daily, and using 
monofocal lenses as opposed to bifocals.

# Urinary tract infection. UA obtained as part of 
toxic-metabolic work-up, returned with ___, nitrites. On further 
questioning, pt does admit to some dysuria. She was treated with 
3 days Ceftriaxone. Urine culture grew E coli, sensitive to CTX.

# Left frontal subdural hematoma: CT scan on ___ notable for 
2.5mm L frontotemporal SDH. She was evaluated by Neurosurgery on 
transfer from OSH, deemed to be non-operable. Does not need 
Neurosurgery follow up. 

# Left wrist fracture: Per Orthopedics: non-operable, continue 
non-weight bearing LUE in splint  

# Left hip fracture: Per Orthopedics, should be weight bearing 
as tolerated in left lower extremity (L hip CT shows L 
comminuted femur fx w/ surrounding hematoma). 

# Anemia: Normocytic, with no evidence of active bleed. Thought 
to be ___ iron deficiency per OSH records, recently started on 
supplementation. Iron studies checked this admission showed 
ferritin 98. Likely she has mixed iron deficiency/anemia of 
chronic disease.

# ___ disease: Continued Carbidopa-Levodopa (___) QID 
 

# Meningioma: Continued keppra 1500mg BID  

# HLD: Continued rosuvastatin  

***Transitional issues***
- diagnosed with subacute subdural hematoma on head CT. Continue 
home Keppra, does not require further neurosurgery follow up 
- will follow up in hand clinic in ___ regarding distal radius 
fracture 
- would recommend single focal lenses as opposed to bifocals to 
help reduce fall risk 
- should discuss evaluation and treatment for likely 
osteoporosis in the setting of recurrent falls 
- clonazepam dose decreased during this hospitalization, would 
discuss discontinuing it if appropriate given patient's advanced 
age and fall risk 
- treated for uncomplicated UTI with 3 days of ceftriaxone
- would recommend obtaining old Neurology records for MMSE/MOCA 
to document decline in patient's mental/functional status

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

You were in the hospital after you fell at home and suffered a 
broken wrist as well as a small bleed in your head. Neither of 
these required surgery. 

We believe you fell because you tripped. We do not think there 
was anything wrong with your heart that would make you fall. 
When you leave the hospital, it will be important for you to 
work with physical therapy to continue getting stronger. 

Best wishes,
Your ___ team

leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic 
valve stenosis (valve area 0.6cm2). The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 

 After valve deployment, a bioprosthetic valve is seen in the 
aortic position. The valve appears well-seated with normally 
mobile leaflets. There are no apparent paravalvular leaks or AI. 
The peak pressure across the aortic valve is 10mmHg, the mean 
gradient is 4mmHg with cardiac output of 4.9L/min.

Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
aortic stenosis

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ because you had transcatheter 
aortic valve replacement (___).

Continue all your current medications with the following 
changes:
-Continue Plavix 75mg daily until otherwise directed.
-Continue aspirin 81mg daily until your INR is therapeutic. Dr. 
___ doctor that put your stent in back in ___ agrees 
that once your INR is therapeutic and stable, it is ok to stop 
the aspirin. Please discuss this plan with Dr. ___ the 
___ Heart Team before you make these changes. 
-Resume lovenox as directed by your ___ clinic. It seems 
they directed you to take 0.45ML 2 TIMES A DAY (of a 150 mg/ml 
syringe.) Continue lovenox until your ___ clinic says its 
ok to stop.
-Resume Coumadin tonight. Your INR today was 1.1. Take Coumadin 
15mg tonight and ___ night and have INR rechecked on ___.
-Start Lasix 10mg every other day until you talk with the 
Structural Heart Team. Start this medication on ___. They 
will be calling you after discharging and may decrease the 
frequency even more. 
-Take amoxicillin 2 gram 1 hour prior to any dental cleaning or 
dental procedure.  Bacteria in your mouth can travel to your new 
heart valve and cause an infection. This antibiotic will help to 
prevent from happening.

If your diarrhea persists after discharge you may want to skip 
your Lasix dose if it is scheduled that day.  The combination of 
diarrhea and the effects of the Lasix pill can cause your blood 
pressure to go too low.  I recommend that you get a new blood 
pressure machine. Omron is a good product and you should be able 
to get it at stores like ___.

It is very important to take all of your heart healthy 
medications. In particular, you are now taking aspirin and 
clopidogrel (also known as Plavix). These two medications keep 
blood clots from forming on the new valve. If you stop these 
medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot 
forming on your new valve. This could cause it to malfunction 
and it may be life threatening. Please do not stop taking either 
medication without taking to your heart doctor, even if another 
doctor tells you to stop the medications.

It is very important to take all of your heart healthy 
medications. In particular, you are now taking aspirin. This 
medication helps to keep blood clots from forming on the new 
valve. If you stop this medication or miss ___ dose, you risk 
causing a blood clot forming on your new valve. This could cause 
it to malfunction and it may be life threatening. Please do not 
stop taking this medication without taking to your heart doctor, 
even if another doctor tells you to stop the medications.

You will need prophylactic antibiotics for the next 6 months 
prior to any dental procedure. Please inform your dentist about 
your recent cardiac procedure and whether the dental procedure 
is necessary. If it is, please inform your cardiologist and have 
your dentist or primary care doctor prescribe amoxicillin 2 gram 
once, 1 hour prior to the procedure.

Please weigh yourself every day in the morning after you go to 
the bathroom and before you get dressed. If your weight goes up 
by more than 3 lbs in 1 day or more than 5 lbs in 3 days, please 
call your heart doctor or your primary care doctor and alert 
them to this change.

We have made changes to your medication list, so please make 
sure to take your medications as directed. You will also need to 
have close follow up with your heart doctor and your primary 
care doctor.

If you have any urgent questions that are related to your 
recovery from your medical issues or are experiencing any 
symptoms that are concerning to you and you think you may need 
to return to the hospital, please call the ___ HeartLine at 
___ to speak to a cardiologist or cardiac nurse 
practitioner.

It was a pleasure to take care of you. We wish you the best with 
your health!

Your ___ Cardiac Care Team

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with past medical history of colon 
cancer, hypertension, dementia admitted ___ with ___ 
secondary to obstructive etiology, status post foley placement, 
course complicated by new stroke and then subsequent GI bleed 
secondary to severe esophagitis, started on high dose PPI, 
restart ASA, subsequently stable, discharged to rehab today

# ___ secondary to urinary obstruction from suspected BPH 
Patient initially with confusion as below, found to have ___, 
with creatinine peaking at 6.8, with radiographic imaging of 
bilateral hydronephrosis felt to be secondary to BPH.  Patient 
had foley placed and was seen by renal and urology service.  
Renal function slowly improved over subsequent 1 week, 
stabilizing at 1.3-1.4, felt to be his baseline.  Of note, 
there several small kidney stones felt to be non-obstructive.  
Urology recommended foley remain in place until outpatient 
follow-up.  He was initiated on tamsulosin.  

# Acute metabolic encephalopathy
Patient presented with 1 week of progressive confusion, found 
to have above ___ and ___ medical problems; mental status 
slowly improved with treatment of problems mentioned elsewhere. 
 

# Stroke of R anterior cerebellar circulation 
On ___, patient was discovered to have new subtle left facial 
droop.  Noncontrast head CT revealed no acute bleeding and 
subsequent MRI ___ showed acute to subacute infarcts within 
the right middle frontal gyrus and right precentral gyrus.  He 
was seen by stroke service who recommended Aspirin and 
simvastatin initiation.  TSH and A1c were within normal limits. 
Given acute GI bleed below and goals of care conversation as 
below, carotid Doppler, CTA head were not pursued as dual 
antiplatelet therapy and carotid endarterectomy were not within 
his goals of care. Patient had physical therapy and 
Occupational Therapy consults who recommended discharge to 
rehab

# Hemorrhagic Shock secondary to severe esophagitis with 
bleeding 
# Acute blood loss anemia
On ___, patient developed acute hypotension, anemia 
(hemoglobin drop from 11.4 to 9.1 to 7.4 over 24 hours) and new 
melena.  He was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells 
and volume resuscitated.  He was seen by GI and underwent 
emergent endoscopy showing severe diffuse esophagitis.  He was 
started on IV PPI twice daily with subsequent stabilization.  
Pt transitioned to PO PPI from IV. ASA was initially held, then 
restarted once he was hemodynamically stable. Hgb was 8.6 at 
discharge. 

# ___
Patient and family expressed with strong desire not to escalate 
care.  Primary team had multiple conversations with healthcare 
proxy ___, who clarified that patient would not want 
transfer to the ICU, invasive procedures, cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation or intubation.  Consistent with his wishes, we 
did not pursue carotid US or further imaging, as he would not 
want CEA and is not a candidate for DAPT.

# Urinary tract infection
In the setting of hypertension on ___, UA was sent which 
revealed a large leuks.  Patient was initiated on IV 
ceftriaxone for 3 day course.  Urine culture revealed E. coli, 
and he was switched to cefpedoxime until ___ to complete a 7 
day course. 

#Thrombocytopenia: Patient was noted to have thrombocytopenia 
to 72k on presentation with normal hemoglobin.  Workup 
unremarkable.  Improved with treatment of above processes.  
Felt to have been suppressed in setting of acute illness.  
Platelets were 150k at discharge.

# History of dysphagia
Recommended for thin liquids and GROUND solids by swallow 
evaluation; 

#HTN: pt was stable off medications. LVH suggestive of 
chronicity on EKG

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,  
 It was a pleasure to care for you at the ___ 
___. 
 
 -Why did you come to the hospital?  
You came to the hospital because you felt weak and had not eaten 
at home in a long time. 
 
-What did you receive in the hospital?  
When you arrived at the hospital, we found your kidneys were not 
working very well, so you had a catheter placed to help your 
body drain urine. You were started on a medication called 
tamsulosin (or Flomax) to help you urinate more easily.  
Additionally, we found that you had a recent small stroke, and 
you had images taken of your ___ and neck.  You were started 
on aspirin and simvastatin for your stroke.  Additionally, you 
had bleeding in your esophagus.  You got a blood transfusion for

IMAGING/STUDIES
-MRI ___
1. No evidence for epidural collection to suggest abscess.  No 
evidence to suggest discitis. 
2. Mild edema and enhancement within the posterior and 
interspinous soft tissues in the mid and upper cervical spine.  
Findings are nonspecific, and correlation with any history of 
recent trauma is recommended.  However, given associated small 
left C4-C5 facet joint effusion and pattern, which could be  
degenerative in nature, given the patient's clinical history, an 
early infectious synovitis with paraspinal soft tissue 
involvement is a consideration. 
3. Multilevel spondylosis of the cervical spine, as detailed 
above.  Findings are most significant at the level of C3-4 with 
moderate canal stenosis, moderate right and minimal left neural 
foraminal narrowing. 
4. Multilevel spondylosis of the lumbar spine, most notable at 
L5-S1 where there is moderate severe bilateral neural foramina 
narrowing as well as  severe crowding of the left subarticular 
zone, likely impinging on the traversing left S1 nerve root. 
5. Additional findings as described above. 

-ECHO ___:  no vegetations seen
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/o IVDU who presents with fever and neck pain found to have 
positive blood cultures.  

Patient left against medical advice. 

1. Bloodstream infection (coag + staph)
-Multiple blood cultures positive for coat + staph concerning 
for endocarditis h/o IVDU, relation to neck process, or 
potential seeding from meningitis started on broad spectrum 
antibiotics.   TTE without vegetation; however, patient refused 
TEE.  After discussion of etiology of bacteremia, workup of 
endocarditis, treatment of endocarditis or other blood stream 
infection with prolonged IV antibiotics ___ weeks with 
PICC/midline, and need to stay in the hospital/rehab she refused 
all further care requesting to sign AMA.  Discussed risk of 
worsening infection including sepsis, shock, stroke, septic 
emboli, end organ damage, paralysis, or death to which she 
expressed understanding and accepted risk.  Given risk of giving 
oral antibiotics without outpatient follow up (not interested in 
PCP) and inadequacy of treating bacteremia with partial work up 
patient was not discharged with antibiotics.   ID consult placed 
but patient left AMA before being seen by them.  PCP arranged to 
help educate patient. 
 
2. Neck pain
-In setting of clinical symptoms presentation concerning for 
meningitis s/p LP in the ED with slightly elevated WBC and 
protein ?viral/bacterial meningitis started on empiric 
antibiotics pending CSF cultures, which have been negative thus 
far. Antibiotic stopped when patient signed AMA due to 
risk>benefit of continuing with anything oral. She was given IV 
toradol, IV dilaudid, and cyclobenzaprine during admission. 

3. IVDU
-Positive for oxycodone, opiates, and methadone.  HIV negative 
with positive Hepatitis C positive, which was discussed with 
patient.  She declined social work.  She left AMA before 
addiction services could see her. 

4. Normocytic Anemia
-Unknown baseline due to paucity of labs.  

5. Asymptomatic Bacteriuria
-UA likely contaminant with no growth urine culture. 

6. Transaminitis/cholestasis
-HCV positive w/ reflex viral load pending.  HAV Ab positive 
with negative IgM suggesting previous vaccination/exposure and 
HBsAb positive with negative HBsAg and HBcAb suggesting 
immunization. Patient must demonstrate sobriety prior to 
discussion about hepatitis C treatment.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

You were admitted with neck pain found to have fever.  You had a 
lumbar puncture, which was concerning for meningitis (infection) 
and started on antibiotic awaiting the results of the cultures.  
You also had blood cultures positive for bacteria; you are at 
high risk of developing an infection on your heart valve called 
endocarditis from your drug use recommending an ultrasound of 
your heart to better evaluation.  

Overall these types of infections require IV antibiotics for -6 
weeks, which you do not want to do at this time.  You also did 
not want to proceed with the ultrasound of your heart to 
investigate for endocarditis.  You are at risk for progression 
of this infection, which could cause worsening infection and 
sepsis, low blood ___ damage, stroke, organ 
damage, and death, which you understood.  The infectious disease 
team was not able to see you before you left and not able to 
provide any recommendations.  

At this time oral antibiotics will not treat this type of 
infection and without further investigation or outpatient follow 
up with a PCP it will be more dangerous to discharge you on 
them.  It is very important for you to get a PCP; we have 
arranged for you to see a PCP here who can continue to discuss 
your ongoing medical issues with you.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.
