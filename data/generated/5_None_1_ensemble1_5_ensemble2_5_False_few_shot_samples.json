Transferred from the MICU to the medicine floor \non ___ given resolving sepsis likely from sacral wound. He was \nstable on the medicine floor with waxing and waning orientation \n(likely his new baseline) requiring intermittent dialysis, pain \nmedicine, and anti-itching medicine.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n=============\n#Intubation d/t mental status\n#Hypercarbic respiratory failure now resolved\n#Chronic Aspiration\nPatient intubated ___ for airway protection iso worsening \nmental status. Multifocal opacities on CT Chest concerning for \naspiration pneumonitis vs pneumonia.  Discussions with wife \nthroughout course indicated that he would want everything done \nincluding trach/PEG if necessary; however of note he would \nrequire C-surg d/t complicated anatomy. He had a prolonged \nintubation due to excessive  secretions and poor mental status. \nHe was able to be extubated ___ and did well. His diet was \nadvanced slowly which he tolerated well. Diet at discharge was \nsoft solids, thin liquids, with 1:1 supervision.\n\n#Toxic metabolic encephalopathy\n#Epileptiform discharges on EEG\n#Altered mental status\n#CVA - right middle cerebellar peduncle\nMental status was poor despite completing treatment for \ninfection above. EEG over multiple days not consistent with \nseizure like activity. MRI brain revealed small punctate infarct \nin right middle cerebellar peduncle; however, this is unlikely \nto explain mental status. MRA with patent circle of ___ \narteries. Patient received keppra 500 BID with extra 500 post \ndialysis on MWF. He received atorvastatin and ASA for CVA risk. \nPlavix was held in setting of bleeding. Neurology and vascular \nsurgery both agreed that Plavix can be discontinued. \n\n# ESRD on ___ HD: \nReceived CRRT due to hypotension; renal followed.

Fecal management system \n(flexiseal) placed to divert stool from open sacral wound and \nhelp with healing. Would need diverting colostomy for definitive \nwound repair, which wife states is absolutely NOT within GOC. \nWound care and ACS followed, recommended enzymatic debridement \nand ultimately placed wound vac. Plastic was not offering flap \nfor closure given comorbidities. On ___, pressor requirement and \nwhite count increased, started vanc/meropenem again given \nblue-green drainage from wound; wound culture grew pseudomonas. \nHe finished course of meropenem on ___. Patient also received \nstress dose steroids in the setting of sepsis. He remained \nstable without any other signs of infection through his hospital \nstay.\n\n# Anemia\n# Hematochezia \nChronic anemia due to renal disease, trended downward ___, with \nCT C/A/P without evidence of bleed. Stool dark and guiac \npositive making GI bleed most likely. Patient was too unstable \nat present to undergo scope. Had visualized melena and \nhematochezia earlier in admission iso likely hypotension/bowel \nischemia which had resolved but bleeding seems to have recurred \nwhile on asa/Plavix for CVA. Plavix was held and hemoglobin \nremained stable. Endoscopic evaluation was deferred. Patient \nreceived PO lansoprazole twice daily for two weeks. He had no \nmore episodes of GI bleeding through his stay and he was \ntransitioned to his home famotidine 20 mg daily. Hemoglobin was \nstable on discharge. \n\n# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus\nPatient was on insulin gtt in the ICU and transitioned to basal \ninsulin glargine 16u with Humalog insulin sliding scale.\n\n#SVT (resolved) \n#Likely MAT\nAppeared to have MAT on EKG while in MICU. Has intermittent \nepisodes of SVT into the 130s while on dialysis. Blood pressure \nhas been stable without any symptoms noted during episodes. Rate \ncontrol is being deferred given soft blood pressures and issues \nwith hypotension during HD. \n\nCHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES\n=======================\n#Nutrition: Began home tube feeds which was advanced\n\n#Transaminase elevation: He had a mild transaminase elevation \nlast admission in ___ thought to be ___ drug effect from \nantibiotics.\" Known to be HCV positive but not active given \nnegative surface antigen. No thrombosis or sign of chronic liver \ndisease on RUQUS. No hx of new drugs that would likely cause \nDILI. Intermittently hypotensive and likely ischemic \nhepatopathy. Resolved.\n\n# PVD: Held atorvastatin initially due to liver injury, \nrestarted atorvastatin after liver function normalized per \nneurology recommendations given vascular disease. Held \ngabapentin throughout his hospital stay due to mental status.\n\n#Gout: Continued allopurinol which was changed to every other \nday dosing on ESRD.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n[] Can likely stop keppra in ___ mo pending Neurology would like \nto see him as an outpatient and they will place EEG and wean him \noff his keppra.

Per records, \nthe patient was first admitted at ___ from ___ with \nhypertensive emergency and multiple falls at home. He was \ndiagnosed with influenza and was given Tamiflu. His hospital \ncourse was complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid \nventricular response, delirium with somnolence after \nbenzodiazepine administration, and acute kidney injury. During \nthe hospital course he had a leukocytosis to 17 for which blood \ncultures were drawn. He was found to have MSSA bacteremia and \nwas placed on cefazolin for a planned four week course from \n___. TTE showed mild-moderate MR without obvious \nvegetation. Given concern for osteo, MRI pelvis was attempted \ntwice but the patient was not able to tolerate the study.

He was \nfound to have right-sided acute and subacute rib fractures \n(___). He was given a TLSO brace for comfort. Pain control was \nattempted with an epidural, but was only marginally effective. \nUltimately, he was discharged back to rehab with oxycontin, \noxycodone, Tylenol, and a fentanyl patch. Of note, patient was \nfound to be occasionally somnolent, and attempts were made to \nreduce his regimen. He was also found to have chest imaging \nfindings concerning for pneumonia. However, given his clinical \npicture was felt more likely to be aspiration in the setting of \nsomnolence. He was continued on cefazolin throughout this \nhospitalization for his MSSA bacteremia, as noted above. \n\nPatient was discharged back to rehab on ___. He completed his \nantibiotics course on ___ as planned. However, since ___ was \nnoted by staff to be altered. No known fevers at rehab. His labs \nwere drawn and notable for a leukocytosis to 17.7.

No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.\n2. Focal hypodensity within the left basal ganglia, likely \ncompatible with\nprior lacunar infarct.\n3. Moderate mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus \nsuggests ongoing\ninflammation.\n \n___ CT ABD/PELVIS:\n1.  Compared with the outside hospital chest CT from ___,\nprogression of the T12 vertebral body compression deformity, now \nwith\nincreased lucency, cortical destruction, paravertebral soft \ntissue, and\nenlarged lucency within the inferior T11 vertebral body.  \nFindings are\nconcerning for infection resulting in osteomyelitis and \ndiscitis, given the\nrapid progression.  Further assessment with MRI is recommended.\n2.  Heterogeneous hyperdense asymmetric enlargement of the left \npsoas muscle at the level of the inferior left kidney, \ncompatible with a hematoma in the setting of known \nanticoagulation.\n3.  New moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent right lung \nbase\nconsolidation and atelectasis.  Superimposed infection is \nconsidered in the\nappropriate clinical setting.  Small left pleural effusion is \nrelatively\nunchanged.\n\n___ MRI SPINE: \n1. The study is degraded by motion artifact.\n2. Pathological fracture of the T12 vertebral body with relative \npreservation of the anterior and posterior vertebral body \nheights.  The central aspect of the vertebral body does not \nenhance in keeping with a pathological fracture most likely \nsecondary to infection.  There is enhancement of the adjacent \nparavertebral soft tissue and there is involvement of the \ninferior aspect of the T11 vertebral body.  These findings are \nmost consistent with a pathological fracture secondary \nto/destruction of the T12 vertebral body by osteomyelitis.\n3.  There is and associated mixed intensity collection the left \npsoas muscle most likely representing a psoas abscess.  The \nsignal intensity of the collection is slightly atypical for an \nabscess being T2 mixed Iso and hyperintense with a surrounding \nT2 hypointense rim and a psoas hematoma secondary to a \npathological fracture should be considered in the differential \ndiagnosis.\n4. Moderate severe spinal canal stenosis at the L3-___s moderate severe left L3-4 neural foraminal narrowing \ndescribed above.\n5. No compromise of the thoracic cord in the thoracic spinal \ncanal.\n6. Small epidural collection at T11-12.\n\nECHO: Suboptimal image quality. \n1) Image quality poor with this limitation in mind no \nechocardiographic evidence of endocarditis seen.\n2) Moderate pulmonary systolic arterial hypertension in setting \nof mild RV dilation and normal RV systolic longitudinal \nfunction. There is moderate tricuspid regurgitation and severe \nRA dilaton. LV e' velocities are high arguing against primary LV \npathology as cause of pulmonary hypertension. \n-The patient has a mildly dilated ascending aorta. Based on ___ \nACCF/AHA Thoracic Aortic Guidelines, if not previously known or \na change, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in ___ year; if \npreviously known and stable, a follow-up echocardiogram is \nsuggested in ___ years. \n\n___ MRI LEFT SHOULDER\n1. No findings specific for septic arthritis of the glenohumeral \njoint.  Trace to small glenohumeral joint effusion, could be \nrelated to rotator cuff pathology and biceps tendon tear, \nsuperimposed infection cannot be excluded.  If clinical concern \nfor septic arthritis, joint fluid sampling could be obtained.\n2. Moderate to high-grade articular surface tearing of the \nsupraspinatus\ntendon with additional full-thickness tear along the leading \nedge.\n3. Moderate tendinosis and interstitial tearing of the \ninfraspinatus tendon\nwith probable calcific tendinitis near its insertion. Recommend \ncorrelation with left shoulder radiographs.\n4. Likely complete tear of the intra-articular portion of the \nbiceps tendon\nwith retraction.\n5. Small amount of subacromial subdeltoid bursal fluid.\n6. Moderate degenerative type changes of the acromioclavicular \njoint.  No\nfindings specific for septic arthritis.\n7. Diffuse red marrow changes.\n\n___ SHOULDER XRAY: Degenerative changes.  No acute fracture \nis seen.  Some narrowing of the acromial humeral interval raises \npossibility of rotator cuff tear.\n\n___ CXR: Right PICC line tip most likely terminates in the \nproximal right atrium and should be pulled back 4 cm.  Patient \nis in pulmonary edema.  Right pleural effusion is moderate.  \nLeft pleural effusion is small.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly.\n\n___: MRI T/L-SPINE\n1. Discitis and osteomyelitis are again demonstrated T11-T12.  \nSevere collapse of T12 vertebral body and minimal T11 vertebral \nbody loss of height are unchanged.  Contrast enhancement in the \nposterior aspect of the T11-T12 disc has increased.  Small right \nanterior epidural phlegmon has slightly increased, displacing \nthe spinal cord without compression. \n2. Unchanged T12-L1 disc edema without enhancement, a \nnonspecific finding \nwhich may be reactive.  New mild edema and contrast enhancement \nin the \nsuperior endplate of L1 may be reactive, though spread of \ninfection cannot be excluded definitively. \n3. Persistent edema and contrast enhancement of the left psoas \nfrom T12 \nthrough S1, with stable peripherally enhancing fluid pockets \nbetween L3 and L5 which may in part be related to hematomas.  \nHowever, superimposed infection and abscess formation cannot be \nexcluded. \n4. Stable mild bilateral posterior paravertebral edema from L2 \nthrough L5. \n5. Multilevel degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, with \nmoderate to \nsevere spinal canal stenosis at L3-L4, are again demonstrated. \n6. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are \nagain partially visualized. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old male with PMH Of DM w/ \nneuropathy, A fib on warfarin, COPD, Charcot foot, gout, kidney \ninjury, CHF, alcohol use disorder, w/ recent admission for MSSA \nbacteremia, readmission for rib fractures, who now presents as a \ntransfer from rehab facility for elevated WBC and new mental \nstatus changes, found to have vertebral osteomyelitis.\n\n# Osteomyelitis \n# Fever, Leukocytosis\n# Sepsis \nPatient presented with new leukocytosis and fever having just \ncompleted a 4 week course of cefazolin on ___ for MSSA \nbacteremia.

She presents to the ED after repeat \nTTE reveals increasing effusion with signs of frank tamponade.\n\nIn regards to her recent hospitalization, she was admitted \n___ for scheduled TAVR. Briefly, her course was c/b CHB \nrequiring temp wire s/p TAVR. Shortly after placement she went \ninto PEA arrest for which she received 1 minute of CPR. This was \n___ dislodged pacer wire. EP then re-placed the temp wire. She \nwas also noted to have a pericardial effusion with tamponade \nphysiology (see below). A PPM was placed on ___. \nAdditionally, she was started on clopidogrel (already on \naspirin) for planned three month duration after which she would \nremain on lifelong ASA.\n\nIn regards to her pericardial effusion, patient was noted to \nhave small pericardial effusion on TTE (___) prior to TAVR \nwhich on repeat TTE on ___ was noted to be increased in size \n(moderate circumferential) without frank tamponade. She \ncompleted pericardiocentesis on ___ with removal of 170 cc of \nfluid that was negative for malignant cells (c/w reactive \ncells). Surveillance TTE on ___ showed rapid re-accumulation of \npericardial fluid, which was described as small to moderate with \necho evidence for increased pericardial pressure and tamponade \nphysiology. While awaiting cytology results she was monitored \nhemodynamically with frequent pulsus paradoxus check and \nsurveillance TTEs.

There is mild-moderate left ventricular \nregional systolic dysfunction with XXX (see schematic) and \nmoderate global hypokinesis of the remaining segments. No \nthrombus or mass is seen in the\nleft ventricle. Quantitative 3D volumetric left ventricular \nejection fraction is 35 % (normal 54-73%). Due to severity of \nmitral regurgitation, intrinsic left ventricular systolic \nfunction is likely lower. Left ventricular cardiac index is \nnormal (>2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular \noutflow tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size \nwith moderate global free wall hypokinesis. Tricuspid annular \nplane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is depressed. The aortic sinus \ndiameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta \ndiameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a \nnormal descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) \nare mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There \nis no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear \nstructurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is \nmoderate mitral annular calcification. There is moderate to \nsevere [3+] mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the \nseverity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The \npulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. The tricuspid valve \nleaflets appear structurally normal. There is mild to moderate \n[___] tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \nregional and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction most \nconsistent with coronary artery disease or other diffuse \nprocess. Moderate to severe mitral regurtitation. Moderate \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Right\nventricular free wall hypokinesis. Compared with the prior TTE \n(images not available for review) of ___, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure is now increased. \n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient's LVEF is less than 40%; a \nthreshold for which they may benefit from a beta blocker and an \nACE inhibitor (or ___ and a mineralocorticoid receptor \nantagonist.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n====================\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: \n==================== \n___, ___, with h/o ESRD on ___ HD, type II \ndiabetes, asthma, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, coronary \nartery disease, HFrEF EF 35%, atrial fibrillation on warfarin \nwho presents with generalized weakness, fevers and epistaxis \nfound to have supratherapeutic INR, hyperkalemia and \ncommunity-acquired pneumonia.

By \ndischarge, had received consistent ___ HD which he was \ntolerating well.\n\n# Supratherapeutic INR\n# Acute on chronic extensive RUE DVT\nPresented with INR > 13.8. Reversed. Once INR dropped, patient \ndeveloped RUE DVT, with ultrasound showing extensive DVT \ninvolving the right subclavian, axillary, and one of the paired \nbrachial veins. Per initial Hematology recommendation, bridged \nwith heparin then transitioned back to warfarin, goal INR ___. \nIt was difficult to achieve a stable INR during his hospital \ncourse and after discussion with renal team, transitioned him to \napixaban 5mg BID. He was discharged with 1 month supply.\n\n# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy\n# Transient aphasia\n# Multifocal intracranial stenosis\nPatient had apparent transient expressive aphasia on ___ in the \nsetting of receiving dialysis. However this was difficult to \nassess given concominant delirium, metabolic derangements and \nrequirement for ___ language interpreter. Neurology was \nconsulted and Code Stroke was called with reassuring workup. CT \nhead, MRI/MRA brain, and CTA head/neck which did not show acute \nstroke, but did demonstrate severe intracranial atherosclerotic \ndisease. Home atorvastatin was increased to 80mg. Continued on \nhome aspirin 81mg.\n\n# Diabetic retinopathy\nNeuro team noted monocular diplopia. He was followed up by \nophthalmology on ___ who noted moderate bilateral cataracts and \nmoderate-severe diabetic retinopathy. Recommended follow up in \nophthalmology clinic.\n\n# Rehab needs:\nSeverely reconditioned.  Pt originally refused transition to \nrehab preferring to return home with family.

Continued on home metoprolol. Digoxin \nheld while on azithro, resumed afterward. He is not on optimal \nmedical therapy for HFrEF. Per last cardiology note, he was \ninitiated on low-dose captopril previously but had hypotension \non HD days, then it was held and on another visit recommended \nrestarting it and holding on HD days. Did not restart while \ninpatient due to hypotension after HD, would resume if able as \nan outpatient. Anticoagulation per above.\n\n# Dyspnea/Chest tightness\nPatient complained intermittently of dyspnea which was thought \nmultifactorial from fluid overload, deconditioning, and asthma. \nEKGs were not concerning for active ischemia. He was treated for \nasthma as below.\n\n# Constipation\nStarted on bowel regimen which was uptitrated to miralax BID and \n2 tabs of senna BID, then started having loose stools. \nDischarged with daily miralax. Please monitor.\n\n# Elevated Lactate\n# Respiratory alkalosis\nHad an episode of respiratory distress iso fluid overload with \nrespiratory alkalosis and lactate of 8 which decreased without \nintervention, thought possibly related to poor renal clearance \nvs. type D from frequent\nnebulizer treatments.\n\n# Leukocytosis\nIntermittently elevated to 10 range, thought iso infection and \ninflammation.\n\n# Asthma\nContinued albuterol prn and fluticasone BID.

Severe cardiomegaly is chronic, \nprobably \nworsened.   \n\nTransvenous right ventricular pacer lead in standard placement.  \nNo \npneumothorax.   \n\nNew right PIC line ends in the right brachiocephalic vein just \nbefore the \norigin of the SVC, approximately 8.5 cm below the estimated \nlocation of the superior cavoatrial junction. \n\n___ TEE\n\nPRE-BYPASS\n\nThe patient is in sinus tachycardia and receiving milrinone 0.25 \nmcg/kg/min, vasopressin 2.4 units/hr, epinephrine 0.03 \nmcg/kg/min, and norepinephrine 0.025 mcg/kg/min.\n\nThe left atrium is markedly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in \nthe left atrium or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is \nmoderately dilated, pacing wires are seen in the RA and RV. No \natrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, \ncolor Doppler or saline contrast with Valsalva maneuvers. The \nleft ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left \nventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= ___ \n%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The \nright ventricular cavity is dilated there is mild hypokinesis of \nthe RV free wall worsening towards the apex. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \nexcursion. There is no aortic stenosis. There is trivial aortic \nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally \nnormal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild \nTR. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nPOST-BYPASS \n\nThe patient is in sinus tachycardia and receiving milrinone \n0.375 mcg/kg/min, vasopressin 2.4 units/hr, epinephrine 0.08 \nmcg/kg/min, and norepinephrine 0.03 mcg/kg/min. Inhaled \nepoprostenol is being administered at 0.05 mcg/kg/min. LVAD \nspeed is adjusted after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass \nwith a final speed of 9000 rpm. \n\nLV dysfunction remains severe. A well-positioned LVAD inflow \ncannula is seen in the LV apex directed towards the MV opening, \nwith inflow velocities < 2.0 m/s. The LVAD outflow cannula is \nappropriately positioned in the ascending aorta with velocities \n< ___ m/s. At an LVAD speed of 9000 rpm the interventricular \nseptum was midline to rightward bowing with partial LV \ndecompression. The aortic valve remained mostly closed at this \nspeed, with occasional partial leaflet opening. \n\nAfter discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass, the right \nventricular dysfunction was mild on the noted inotropic support. \nWith chest closure, the outflow graft appeared to compress a \nportion of the RV free wall, creating moderate dysfunction; \nhowever there were no significant changes in hemodynamic \nmeasurements, SVO2, or CI. \n\nThe thoracic aorta remains intact.\n\n___ TTE\n\nThe coronary sinus is dilated (diameter >15mm). Left ventricular \nwall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe \nglobal left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF <20 %). The right \nventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global free \nwall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The \naortic valve does not open. The mitral valve appears \nstructurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate \n[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial \neffusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nbiventricular systolic function is now more depressed, a \nHeartmate is now seen, and the aortic valve no longer opens\n\n___ CTA CORONARY ARTERY WITH 3D W/F\n\nADDENDUM  In addition to the previously reported findings and \nimpression:\nAn anterior mediastinal hematoma and potential pericardial \neffusion may also\ncontribute to compression of the anterior wall of the right \nventricle,\nsubstantial reduction in right ventricular volume, and \nflattening of the\ninterventricular septum compared to the pre-operative exam in \n___.  The\ndegree of mediastinal hematoma and pericardial effusion is \ndifficult to\ndistinguish on the current exam.\n \nRecommend repeating an echocardiogram to further evaluate, and \nconsider\nrepeating cardiac CTA depending on the patient's current \nclinical status.\n \nCorrection to the original report:  Smooth, circumferential \nfilling defect in\nthe inflow and outflow LVAD cannula is not partial thrombus but \nrather the\nexpected CT appearance of the cannula wall.\n\n___ LOWER EXT US \n\nNo evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower \nextremity\nveins.\n\n___ UPPER EXT US \n\nNonocclusive thrombus surrounding the pacemaker lead in the mid \nto distal left\nsubclavian vein.\n \nNo evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper extremity \nveins.\n\n___ CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST\n \nThere is a hyperdense collection measuring 77 x 56 mm in the \naxial plane and\n81 Hounsfield units seen in the left lateral chest wall in \nrelation to the\nserratus anterior muscle with associated air locules and \nsurrounding\nsubcentimeter lymph nodes suggestive of superimposed infection \n(on previous\nstudy done ___ there was a hematoma is seen in the \nleft serratus\nanterior muscle).  This process is remote from the LVAD.\n \nMetallic streak artifact obscures the soft tissue/ pump pocket \nsurrounding the\nLVAD, but there is no obvious ___ LVAD collection or \nextravasation of\ncontrast.\n \nThere is interval improvement in the anterior mediastinal \nhematoma and\nhemorrhagic left pleural effusion.\n \nA few air locules seen in the right atrium which is thought to \nbe secondary to\nair injection and not suggestive of mediastinitis.  However if \nthe clinical\nsuspicion for mediastinitis is high then a non contrasted CT may \nbe performed\nto exclude mediastinal air locules/mediastinitis with absolute \ncertainty.\n \nThe median position of the LVAD outflow tract is again noted \nwith mass effect\non the right ventricle, but there is less right atrial \ndistention and reflux\nof contrast into the hepatic veins compared to immediate \nprevious study done\n___.\n\n___ ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND\n\nNo focal collection identified in the area of tenderness as \nindicated by the\npatient.\n\n \n___ LEFT SHOULDER X RAY \n\nNormal left shoulder radiographs.\n\n___ CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST\n\nSingle air bubble likely within upper margin of the right \natrium; previously\nseen additional air bubbles have resolved.\n\n___ ECHOCARDIOGRAM \n\nThe right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right \nventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall \nhypokinesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+] \ntricuspid regurgitation is seen. [In the setting of at least \nmoderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to \na very high right atrial pressure.] \n\nIntermittent aortic valve opening is seen at 9200 RPM. At all \nhigher pump speeds, little or no aortic valve opening is seen. \nThe interventricular septum is in a leftward displaced \nconfiguration at all speeds higher than 9200 RPM (neutral at \n9000 and 9200 RPM), with severe tricuspid regurgitation and \nright ventricular dilation at all speeds. \n\n___ CT HEAD (episode of unresponsiveness)\n \nThere is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass.  \nThe\nventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration.\n \nThere is no evidence of fracture.  A mucous retention cyst is \nseen in the\nright maxillary sinus.  Remaining visualized paranasal sinuses, \nmastoid air\ncells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  The globes are \nunremarkable.\n \nIMPRESSION:\n\n1.

He\nrequired milrinone therapy and diuresis for optimization.  He \nwas\nnot a candidate for a heart transplant due to his\nmorbid obesity.  I was asked to evaluate him for\nconsideration of LVAD destination therapy.  The risks and\nbenefits of the operation were discussed with the patient, he\nconsented to proceed.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After the patient was placed under\nanesthesia and intubated, his chest, abdomen, and lower\nextremities were prepped with chlorhexidine and draped in the\nusual fashion.  The intraoperative transesophageal\nechocardiogram showed that his left ventricular function had\nan ejection fraction of 10% to 20%.  He had a dilated right\nventricular cavity with mild global right ventricular free\nwall hypokinesis.  He had mild mitral regurgitation and trace\naortic regurgitation.  There was no PFO.\n\nA median sternotomy was made.  The incision was extended a\ncouple centimeters below the xiphoid process.  The\npreperitoneal pocket was created and the pericardium was\nopened up.  The patient was fully heparinized prior to\ninserting the aortic cannula and a venous cannula into the\nright atrial appendage.  We went on bypass.  I elevated the\nleft ventricular apex and identified the dimpled portion.  I\ncored out the LV apex and anchored the apical sewing ring with\npledgeted ___ Ethibond sutures.  BioGlue was then sprayed around\nthe raw surface and around the suture line.  The pump was then\nattached to the apical sewing ring and tied down with a heavy\nsuture and fastened with a silastic strap for reinforcement.  \nThe\noutflow graft was then connected up to the pump.  A side-biting\nclamp was placed on the proximal ascending aorta and the graft\nwas measured and cut appropriately at a beveled angle.\nLongitudinal aortotomy was made and the outflow graft was\nthen sewn to the aorta with running ___ Prolene sutures.  A\nde-airing needle was placed into the graft.  The drive line,\nwhich had been brought out through the left side of the \nabdominal wall, was then connected up to the controller.  We\nstarted at 6000 rpm.  The patient was ventilated.  The\nside-biting clamp was released.  As we came down on the\ncardiopulmonary bypass machine, we went up on the rpm of the\npump.  There was minimal air seen on the echocardiogram. The\napical ring was in good position. With the assistance from \nthe echocardiogram, we adjusted the rpm until the left\nventricular cavity was adequately decompressed.  The\nintraventricular septum was midline.  The right ventricular\ndysfunction was mild with some inotropic support.  Protamine\nwas given to reverse heparin.  The cannulas were removed.\nThree chest tubes were inserted, one in the left apical/left\npleural space and two in the anterior mediastinum.  A piece of\nGortex tube graft was used to cover the outflow graft. The\npericardium was reapproximated around the aorta and the right\nventricle and the remaining opening was covered with\nCorMatrix.  The sternum was closed with stainless steel\nwires.  The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous tissues were\nclosed in 2 layers with running Vicryl sutures.  The skin was\nclosed with running subcuticular Monocryl sutures.  Prevena\nwas placed over the incision.  The patient left the\noperating room, intubated and in stable condition, on\ninotropes and pressors.\n\n___ LEFT CHEST TUBE INSERTION\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:  None.\n\nINDICATIONS:  This is a ___ male who underwent\nplacement of an LVAD on ___.  Postoperatively, he\ndeveloped a large left pleural effusion.  I recommended\ndraining his effusion and discussed the risks and benefits of\na chest tube insertion with the patient.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Patient was placed in a slight\nright lateral decubitus position.  His left chest was prepped\nwith chlorhexidine and draped in the usual fashion.  1%\nlidocaine was used to infiltrate the subcutaneous tissues, as\nwell as the intercostal area.  An incision was made.\nDissection was carried down into the chest wall.  I entered\nthe interspace and inserted a ___ angled chest tube,\nangled posteriorly.  The fluid that we got back was\nserosanguineous in nature.  A total of 1090 cc of fluid was\ndrained.  The chest tube was anchored down with silk sutures\nand a dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the\nprocedure.\n\n==========================\nMICRO\n==========================\n\n___ blood cultures:  No growth.\n\n___ and ___ CATH TIP: NO GROWTH \n\n___ - ___, multiple sets of blood cultures all \nnegative/NGTD. \n\n___ and ___ STOOL: Negative for toxigenic C. difficile \nby the Illumigene DNA amplification assay.

Hemodynamically stable, \nrectal exam in ED showed bright red blood in the rectal vault. \nPrior BRBPR in ___ with colonoscopy showing diverticulosis and \ngrade 1 internal hemorrhoids. CT non-contrast of abdomen with \nevidence of thickening that could be secondary to infectious vs. \nischemic colitis. Patients current symptoms could be secondary \nto ischemic colitis given association with pain and crampy \nnature in addition to slightly elevated lactate. Given \npossibility of infectious etiology we started ciprofloxin/flagyl \nfor 5 day course (___)\nColonoscopy (___) was consistent with colitis in the \ndescending colon.

Your blood numbers \n(hemoglobin) were slightly lower than usual. \n\nWe performed a colonoscopy that showed inflammation called \ncolitis. This was likely something called ischemic colitis, \nwhich occurs when there is low blood pressure to the intestines. \nIt may also be infectious. A biopsy was taken to confirm these \nresults.\n\nFor ischemic colitis, it is important that your blood pressure \nremain stable and not go too low. Because of that, we held your \nlosartan and spironolactone. You will also complete a 5 day \ncourse of antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole).\n\nYou were stable and discharged home after the procedure.\n\nIt was a privilege to care for you in the hospital, and we wish \nyou all the best.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour ___ Health Team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n\n",

Foley was placed and he \nauto-diuresed to dry weight with resolution of hypoxemia. \n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n==========================================\n# Hypoxemia\n# Interstitial lung disease\n# Pulmonary edema\nPatient presented with two days of cough and shortness of breath \nwith preceding fatigue of about 10 days. He was found to have \nhypoxemia to\nmid-80s and admitted for further work-up. CT chest w/o contrast \nshowed asymmetric but bilateral reticulation and ground glass \nopacities as well as bronchiectasis and dilation of airways most \nsevere in RUL, with LUL relatively spared. These findings were \nfelt to be consistent with ILD with both an active inflammatory \nand chronic component. Initial TTE revealed EF 50%, severe pHTN \n(PASP 71), and RV hypertrophy, concerning for chronic pulmonary \nhypertension process. Pulmonary was consulted and recommended \nbroad work-up for ILD which was negative including: ___, ANCA, \ndsDNA, RF, anti-GBM, ___, anti-RNP, anti-Ro, anti-La, \nScl70, anti-CCP, HIV, aldolase, myositis panel, and respiratory \nviral panel. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel was pending at \ntime of discharge. The patient initially required ___ NC for \nsupplemental O2, which was subsequently able to be weaned off \nwith diuresis (see below). After the patient was felt to have \ndiuresed to his dry weight, repeat CXR and TTE were obtained \nwhich showed improvement in pulmonary HTN and lung opacities. \n\n# Hypertensive emergency\nOn presentation the patient was noted to have elevated blood \npressures to 200s/100s. Although he was asymptomatic, he was \nnoted to have significant O2 requirement felt to be secondary to \npulmonary edema. He was started on nitroglycerin gtt titrated to \nSBP 140s-160s, then weaned to labetalol and hydralazine. \nEventually he was transitioned to a regimen of labetalol and \namlodipine which good BP control. His home atenolol was held in \nthe setting ___ (see below). His blood pressures remained \nstable. \n\n# Acute kidney injury, post-renal\nBaseline creatinine 1.2 in ___. On admission the patient was \nfound to have Cr 2.4 which subsequently rose to 3.0. Renal \nultrasound showed moderate bilateral hydroureteral nephrosis \nconsistent with obstruction. Notably the patient has a history \nof prostate cancer and a very enlarged prostate. He did have \ntraumatic foley placement and eventually required cystoscopic \nplacement of foley by Urology. Afterwards he was noted to have \nsignificant urine output of ___ daily and subsequent \nimprovement in his creatinine. Per Urology, foley remained in \nplace at discharge with plan for Urology follow-up. He was \ncontinued on doxazosin 4mg QHS and finasteride 5mg QD which he \nhad recently stopped. \n\n# Normocytic anemia\nBaseline Hb 13.3. The patient presented with Hb at 10.6. Other \nthan intermittent hematuria he had no evidence of bleeding. Iron \nstudies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease with low \nreticulocyte count indicating inflammatory block.

Alternatively, fever \nmay be secondary to infectious process but in the absence of\nfocal infectious symptoms unlikely. In light of her infectious \nrisk however, we sent blood culture, urine culture, urinalysis \n(all negative). As there was potential exposure to \nparainfluenza, we obtained a rapid influenza panel (negative) \nand rapid viral panel (pending). Deferred empiric antibiotics \nfor now as she is not neutropenic and does not have focal \nsymptoms. CXR did not reveal pneumonia. Also, there was some \nthought that her fever may be secondary to Bactrim as \neosinophils were uptrending since restarting Bactrim though she \nremains without rash. She remains\nhemodynamically stable, without concerns for neurotoxicity \nand/or progressive CRS symptoms. Of note, developed grade I CRS \nduring week 3 treatment characterized by low grade fevers and \nrelative hypotension [___]\n\n#RECURRENT HIGH GRADE LYMPHOMA: \n#ENCOUNTER FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY:\nUnfortunately, noted for recurrence of high grade lymphoma over \n___ years following initial treatment for primary bone lymphoma. \nGiven the aggressive nature of the lymphoma, treated with 2 \ncycles of R-EPOCH, which she tolerated very well. ___ PET scan \nshowed good response. She received monthly Rituxan thereafter. \nShe presented on ___ with new c/o breast lumps. Breast Bx ___ \nshowed high grade lymphoma. Thereafter, she had a PET CT that \nshowed an FDG avid cervical node as well as FDG uptake in the \nright distal tibia. Given these findings, trial w/ immunotherapy\nagent with bispecific antibody was offered to patient. Work up \nfor BITE included a BMBX which was negative for lymphoma \ninvolvement. Brain MRI was unremarkable for disease, and MRI \nankle to further assess if that is a site of disease. She is s/p\nweek 3 of protocol ___ with bi-specific antibody therapy, now \nadmitted for week 4. Notably, during week three, she has \npalpable lymph nodes (tonsillar, cervical and breast) that \ndeveloped after BITE was administered but slowly becoming \nsmaller (? likely from pseudo-progression). She continues on \nprophylaxis w/ Acyclovir BID\nDuring admission re-trialed Bactrim for PCP ppx, which she \ntolerated without rash.

Patient was also found to be severely hypothyroid and \nhad a urinary tract infection on presentation. Etiology of \nhyponatremia likely due to combination of extrarenal losses from \ndiarrhea, SIADH, and hypothyroidism. Blood sodium level was \nslowly increased with IV NS boluses as well as changing tubefeed \nregimen. Salt tabs were also started with resolution of \nhyponatremia. Patient was found to be severely hypothyroid and \nlevothyroxine was started with plan to continue titrating up \nlevothyroxine dose following discharge. Urine culture in the \nemergency department grew pseudomonas which was sensitive to \nciprofloxacin and patient completed 3 day course. Patient was \ndischarged on salt tabs and modified tubefeed regimen as well as \n50 mcg daily levothyroxine.\n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n===============\n# Hyponatremia:\n# Diarrhea:\n# SIADH:\nNa incidentally found to be 123. Uosm >100, UNa<20 on admission, \nconsistent with hypovolemia, likely due to diarrhea at home \n(unknown etiology) contributing to extrarenal losses. Patient \ndid have antibiotic treatment after arriving at the hospital but \nsuspicion for C. diff was low as diarrhea started prior to \nadmission. Hypothyroidism possibly contributing as well (see \nbelow). Noted that duloxetine can cause hyponatremia in the \nelderly, but the time course of hyponatremia did not fit this as \nbeing a cause. Patient was initially given IV NS with \nappropriately slow response of ~6 mEq/24 hours increase in serum \nNa. Patient was also determined to have a component of SIADH \nwith urine Na>40 and urine osm>100 on later urine electrolyte \ncheck. Tubefeeds were adjusted to have higher solute content and \nminimize free water intake. Salt tabs were started with good \nresponse. Patient was discharged on salt tabs and new tubefeed \nregimen per nutrition and sodium level on discharge was 135. The \npatient was provided with a script for a lab draw on discharge \nand the need for monitoring was communicated with her outpatient \nprovider.\n\n# Hypothyroidism\nTSH was checked as part of euvolemic hyponatremia workup. Found \nto be 96 with FT4 1.4. Endocrine was consulted and recommended \nstarting levothyroxine at 50 mcg with long term plan to titrate \nup dose. Cosyntropin stim test was performed to rule out adrenal \ninsufficiency; result was normal. Additionally, tubefeeds were \nchanged to 20 hours a day as levothyroxine absorption is \ndisrupted by continuous tubefeeds. TSH and FT4 were rechecked on \ndischarge but were pending at discharge. See transitional issues \nfor long-term plan regaring levothyroxine.\n\n# Urinary tract infection\nPatient with positive urinalysis on admission w/ nitrites and \n___, WBC in urine and mild leukocytosis. Patient was treated with \n3 days of ceftriaxone while urine culture pended. Urine culture \nfrom ED grew pseudomonas aeruginosa, so patient also received 3 \nday course of ciprofloxacin.\n\n# Nutrition\nPatient's tubefeed regimens were switched around several times \nthis admission as the team pursued tubefeed regimen initially \nthat would limit free water and maximize solute, and then had to \nreadjust again to make 4 hour gap in the day to administer \nlevothyroxine. Patient was discharged on new tubefeed regimen \nper nutrition. Additionally, patient received zinc and ascorbic \nacid repletion to continue on discharge for 11 and 3 additional \ndays, respectively\n\n# Skin breakdown\nPatient admitted with coccyx and partially on inner thighs. Per \nson, patient had much worse pressure ulcers upon discharge from \na nursing home she was briefly put in earlier this year. Wound \ncare was consulted and their recommendations were followed.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n# Non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes\nHome metformin and glipizide were held while in house and \npatient was on humalog sliding scale. Blood glucose levels were \nwell controlled with the exception of one day when patient was \non osmolite - resolved with switch back to glucerna tubefeeds.\n\n# UC\nContinued home mesalamine and ursodiol\n\n# Hx of CVA\nContinued home asa, statin. Continued home keppra, \nmethylphenidate\n\n# GERD: \nContinued home PPI\n\n# Constipation\nContinued home bowel reg\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n[ ] Several changes were made this admission that could affect \npatient's sodium levels including new tubefeed regimen, starting \nsalt tabs, and treating her hypothyroidism. She will need close \nmonitoring of her sodium level in the period following \ndischarge. The patient was provided with a script for a lab draw \non discharge. \n\n[ ] Note that patient has been on duloxetine, which is known to \ncause hyponatremia in the elderly. Though the time course of her \nhyponatremia does not necessarily suggest that this is a factor \nin her hyponatremia, this medication should be noted moving \nforward and one might consider whether this medication is \nactually providing any benefit to her.\n\n[ ] Patient was found to be severely hypothyroid this admission. \nThe endocrinologists have recommended the following scheduling \nof tracking thyroid function tests (TFT's) and adjusting \nlevothyroxine (Lt4) doses:\n-Recheck TFT's on ___ including TSH and free T4 (NOT T4 by \ndialysis). If T4/T3 labs show an increase and she continues to \ntolerate the medication, continue levothyroxine at 50mcg.\n- ___ Increase levothyroxine to 75mcg\n- ___ Recheck TSH and ___ If absorption is good and TSH begins to respond, then \nincrease levothyroxine to 100 mcg. Based on her initial weight, \ngoal levothyroxine (1.6x weight in kilos) would be around 122.5.\n\nMEDICATION CHANGES\nNew medications:\n[ ] Sodium chloride tabs 1 gm po/ng tid\n[ ] Levothyroxine sodium 50 mcg po/ng daily\n[ ] Zinc sulfate 220 mg po/ng daily for 11 additional days\n[ ] Ascorbic acid ___ mg po/ng bid for 3 additional days\n\nChanged medications:\nNone\n\nHeld medications:\nNone\n\nName of health care ___\nRelationship:son\nPhone ___\nCell ___\nCode: full presumed\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You were given \nIV fluids with sodium in them to increase your blood sodium \nlevel. Additionally, your tubefeeds were modified as your \nmedical team and nutritionists tried to determine the optimal \ntubefeeding regimen for you. You were also started on salt tabs \nto help keep your sodium level from falling.\n\n- You were found to have a very low level of thyroid hormone in \nyour body. The thyroid affects several functions in your body \nincluding metabolism and electrolyte balance. You were seen by \nour endocrinologists and started on a medication given through \nyour PEG tube to replenish thyroid hormone.\n\n- You were also incidentally found to have a urinary tract \ninfection, which was treated with a full course of the \nappropriate antibiotics.\n\n- You were continued on your home medications for your chronic \nillnesses as appropriate.\n\nWhat should I do when I leave the hospital?  \n- Be sure to take all of your medications exactly as prescribed.\n\n- You are being discharged on a modified tubefeeding regimen \nwhich will only be running for 20 hours in the day. This is \nbecause one of your new medications called levothyroxine, which \nis meant to treat your hypothyroidism, is not well absorbed when \ntubefeeds are running. Therefore, please take your levothyroxine \nexactly 2 hours after stopping tubefeeds each day.\n\n- Please limit water flushes to 100 mL with medications only. \n\n- Given the changes we have made during this hospital admission, \nyou will need your sodium level checked frequently in the period \nfollowing discharge.\n\n- Additionally, our endocrinologists have recommended a specific \nschedule of checking thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone \nlevels with appropriate dose adjustments in your thyroid \nmedication for the next few weeks. A copy of these instructions \nwill be forwarded to your home nurses.\n\n- Be sure to attend all of your follow up appointments as \nscheduled.\n\nSincerely,  \nYour ___ Care Team  \n\nMEDICATION CHANGES\nNew medications:\n[ ] Sodium chloride tabs 1 gm po/ng tid\n[ ] Levothyroxine sodium 50 mcg po/ng daily\n[ ] Zinc sulfate 220 mg po/ng daily for 11 additional days\n[ ] Ascorbic acid ___ mg po/ng bid for 3 additional days\n\nChanged medications:\nNone\n\nHeld medications:\nNone\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n\n \nName:  ___                   Unit No:   ___\n \nAdmission Date:  ___              Discharge Date:   ___\n \nDate of Birth:  ___             Sex:   M\n \nService: MEDICINE\n \nAllergies: \nBactrim / ibuprofen / morphine / NSAIDS (Non-Steroidal \nAnti-Inflammatory Drug)\n \nAttending: ___.\n \nChief Complaint:\nWorsening back pain, lower extremity pain \n \nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\n1.

Postoperative changes are seen in the lumbar ___ with \ninterbody graft at L3-4 level. There is anterior epidural soft \ntissue prominence seen at L3-4 low which could be secondary to \nrecurrent disc herniation or changes of discitis. No definite \nabscess is identified. The evaluation of the areas limited due \nto surrounding metallic artifacts. Correlation with prior \nimaging would be helpful and if none is available, further \nevaluation can be obtained with gallium scan to exclude spinal \ninfection in the setting of metallic hardware. 2. Posterior \nenhancing soft tissues in the lumbar region could be due to \nsurgery and postoperative change with no evidence of fluid \ncollection to indicate abscess but infection of the soft tissue \nwound is difficult to evaluate or exclude on MRI appearances \nalone and clinical correlation is recommended. 3. No evidence of \nabscess, diskitis or osteomyelitis in the cervical or thoracic \nregion. No cord compression.\n\n+ LUMBAR SINGLE VIEW S/P HARDWARE REMOVAL ___\n\nImages demonstrate previous surgery lumbar ___, with interbody \ndevices at the presumed L3-4 and L4-5 levels. Anterior screw and \nwasher demonstrated at L5. Surgical instruments are demonstrated \nposterior to the mid to lower lumbar ___. For details of the \nprocedure please see the procedure report. \n\n+ TTE (___): The left atrial volume index is normal. Normal \nleft ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global \nsystolic function (3D LVEF = 62%). Tissue Doppler imaging \nsuggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure \n(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good \nleaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \nregurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic \nvalve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial \nmitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the \nmitral valve. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure \nis normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. \n\nCT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS (___): \n1. Status post removal of lower lumbar fusion hardware as \ndescribed above. \n2. Residual interbody graft at L3-4, with ventral epidural \nabnormality at this level causing probably moderate central \ncanal narrowing, stable,, may reflect residual disc herniation \nversus phlegmon.  Given mild enhancement of the adjacent right \npsoas muscle, also present on prior, findings may favor \ninfection.  There is mild endplate irregularity of adjacent \nsuperior L4 endplate, indeterminate, this should be followed. \n3.

Found to have orthostatic hypotension likely \nfrom velcade toxicity and autonomic dysfunction from T2DM. After \nautonomic testing with neurology, was started on midodrine \nduring the day for orthostasis and captopril at night for supine \nhypertension, with improvement in symptoms prior to discharge.\n\n#L fibular fracture\nPatient presented to ___ following a fall from chair. He fell \nfrom his chair, without loss of consciousness, unwitnessed, \nhitting head and chin on the table while also suffering a \ntraumatic fracture to his distal fibula and posterior malleolus. \nOn ___ he had an open reduction internal trimalleolar fracture \npattern with out fixation of the posterior malleolus, \nexamination under anesthesia with manually applied rotational \nstress under fluoroscopy, fixation of the syndesmosis. \nPostoperatively recovered well, Lovenox (___) held and \nrestarted postoperatively. Had short cast placed on ___ with \nplan for follow-up with orthopedics in 4 weeks. \n\n# Dysautonomia \n# Postural hypotension\n# Supine hypertension and orthostatic hypotension - Patient with \nsignificant orthostatic hypotension that likely led to fall and \nfracture per above. During hospitalization consistently had SBP \nranging from 160-200s with significant orthostasis on standing \nwith SBP drops by 80mmHg on standing initially with symptoms \nincluding lightheadedness. Neurology autonomics was consulted \nand given temporal association of new orthostatic hypotension \nafter velcade treatment previously, strong clinical suspicion \nthat his postural hypotension was secondary to velcade with a \ncomponent of T2DM dysautonomia. He underwent autonomics testing \nwith neurology, was started on midodrine 2.5mg TID. Plan moving \nforward is for patient to receive midodrine 2.5mg at 8AM, 12PM \nand 4PM if patient is planning on standing. If he remains \nsupine, no need to give midodrine. To treat his supine \nhypertension, patient was prescribed captopril 2.5mg QHS at \n___. He did not symptomatically improve while trialing \nlabetalol during hospitalization, however did have improvement \nin his symptoms with midodrine and captopril. It is anticipated \npatient will continue to have SBP drops while standing however \nhis symptoms while assuming a standing position resolved prior \nto discharge. Of note patient was also previously on prednisone \n10mg daily due to prior concern for adrenal insufficiency, \nhowever has not been taking recently. Repeat cosyntropin \nstimulation test here showed no evidence of adrenal \ninsufficiency. \n\n#Headache \nDeveloped L temporal headache with lacrimation ___ \ninitially with concern for cluster headache. Without improvement \nwith oxygen therapy, resolved with Compazine. It is possible \nheadache is likely secondary to symptomatic supine HTN as \npatient noted resolution of HA with head elevation.

She had \nworsening mental status and rising lactate. An echocardiogram \nrevealed right ventricular collapse explaining obstructive \nshock. She was taken to the cath lab for LV support and had an \nImpella placed. However, she continued to be hypotensive. She \nhad her pericardial fluid drained with transient improvement in \nher hemodynamics, but she quickly decompensated in the setting \nof bleed from punctured ventrical. Cardiac surgery was urgently \nconsulted and she was taken to the operating room. She underwent \nrepair of RV rupture and CABG x 1. The patient left the \nOperating Room in critical but stable condition with an open \nchest. She required vasopressor and inotropic support- which was \nweaned in the immediate post-op days.  Hemodynamics improved and \nchest was closed on POD 3. She was found to be thrombocytopenic \nand HIT was positive. Anti-coagulation was initiated with \nBivalrudin. Hematology was consulted and subsequently SRA \nreturned negative.  Bivalrudin was discontinued. Her \nhemodynamics improved, she was adequately diuresed and was able \nto extubate three days following chest closure. Chest tubes and \npacing wires were discontinued without complication. She \ninitially exhibited confusion and was started on Seroquel with \ngood effect.  \nFoley had to be re-placed for urinary retention.  Flomax was \nstarted with good effect  Foley was discontinued and she \nsuccessfully passed a void trial.  \nBeta blocker was initiated and she was gently diuresed toward \nthe preoperative weight. She was transferred to the telemetry \nfloor for further recovery. She was evaluated by the physical \ntherapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By \nthe time of discharge on POD 12 she was ambulating freely, the \nwound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. \nShe was discharged to ___ at ___ in good condition \nwith appropriate follow up instructions.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.

The \nsurgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the \nprocedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.\n\nPostoperative course was remarkable for the following:\nOvernight on POD#0, the patient was given a bolus of 500 mL of \nfluid for low urine output.  His urine output stabilized \npost-bolus. \n\n#Thrombocytopenia, Plt started at 64 but improved to 94 at time \nof discharge. Lovenox was continued without worsening of \nbaseline thrombocytopenia\n\n#Hyponatremia, likely ___ hypervolemia with low intravascular \nvolume and hypotension. Patient was noted to third space fluid \nin previous surgical interventions (12L positive on last \nadmission, developed diffuse lower extremity edema), re-started \nhome Lasix dose given urine output likely Lasix dependent. Blood \npressures stabilized. Sodium improved to 133 at time of \ndischarge. \n\n___, Cr remained at 1.3, likely due to third spacing of fluid \nand low intravascular volume, pre-renal, held fluid repletion \ngiven above, will get repeat labs as outpatient to ensure renal \nfunction returns to baseline. \n\n#Altered mental status: Patient confused but orientable on \nPOD#3. No focal deficits. Talked to wife. Started empiric cipro \ngiven fever last night with pending cultures. Cultures showed no \ngrowth, Cipro was discontinued. Switched from oxy to tramadol \ngiven improved pain tolerance and confusion. \n\nOtherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral \npain medications.  The patient received lovenox for DVT \nprophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The foley was \nremoved and the patient was voiding independently thereafter. \nThe surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical \nincision was found to be clean and intact without erythema or \nabnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical \ntherapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and \nrepleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was \ntolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was \nafebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was \nacceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral \nregimen.

Upon \nadmission to ___ he underwent emergent cardiac catheterization \nwhich was not revealing of a culprit coronary lesion. He was \nadmitted to the medical service and maintained on minimal \nvasopressor support overnight. He arrived intubated and was \nmaintained on minimal sedation. he was started on broad spectrum \nantibiotics to cover for septic physiology. Central line was \nplaced. Roughly 12 hours after admission he became acutely \nhypotensive. non invasive blood pressure recording were \nunreliable. Rhythm on telemetry and EKG demonstrated atrial \nfibrillation but there was concern for development of new LBBB. \nHe underwent bedside TTE and recurrent cardiology evaluation. \nTTE was notable for mildly depressed LV function, RV free wall \nhypokinesis and severe aortic stenosis (previous TTE from ___ in partners system notable for mild aortic stenosis). He \nrequired escalating doses of 3 vasopressors with subsequent \nworsening in his atrial fibrillation. This correlated with \nworsening hypoxia despite increase in Fi)2 to 100%. Several \nhours later he suffered PEA arrest. Code blue was called in the \nICU around 1100 and CPR was initiated for pulselessness. He had \nasystole on rhythm check and was given 7 rounds of epi and 3 \nbicarb and was transcutaneously paced (had intermittent RBBB and \nLBBB this morning on telemetry) and he developed VT and was \nshocked 300 x1 and 360 x2 with conversion to a regular rhythm \n~80s. He was still pulseless and CPR was performed for a total \nof about 30 minutes prior to calling the\ncode. There was no mechanical activity with bedside v-scan \nthroughout the code. The patient's partner (___) was \nin the room during the beginning of the code and at the bedside \nat the end. The code was called at 1137 am on ___.\n\nOTHER MEDICAL ISSUES \n====================\n# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Patient was intubated at \nthe OSH in the setting of cardiac arrest. CXR was notable for \nprominent bilateral pulmonary edema likely in the setting of \nknown HFpEF, worsened in the setting of cardiac arrest. \nRespiratory arrest could have been driven largely by fluid, \nflash pulmonary edema event. Less likely to represent PE given \ntherapeutic anticoagulation on warfarin at the time of \nadmission. He remained sedated and intubated during admission. \nHe became increasingly hypoxic despite 100% FiO2 and suffered \nPEA arrest as above.  \n\n# Concern for STEMI \n# S/p cardiac arrest  \n# CAD s/p RCA stent in ___:  \nPatient developed chest pain and dyspnea, presented to OSH where \nhe had a VT arrest with ROSC s/p 2 minutes of compressions (no \ndefibrillation). His troponin elevated to 1.68, and EKG showed \nST elevation of aVR with depression in multiple leads concerning \nfor proximal left disease. Upon admission to ___ he was taken \nemergently for cardiac cath without culprit coronary lesions. He \nwas transferred to the MICU following. Cardiology followed and \nwas involved during the remainder of his hospitalization as \nabove. \n\n# Acute on chronic HFpEF: Patient with history of diastolic \nheart failure and was admitted with elevated BNP and severe \npulmonary edema on CXR c/f acute on chronic HFpEF.

He continued to worsen over the course \nof the day (worsening bleeding in the lung, cardiopulmonary \ncollapse, worsening acidosis). Agreed that he would want a \nlimited trial of non-painful interventions (antibiotics, \nsteroids) for now if they did not cause discomfort. Agreed that \nhe would not want CPR. Avoid invasive procedures if they are \nuncomfortable and have low chance of success. he was maintained \non the ventilator for some time but continued to worsen. The \ndecision was made by his family for him to be extubated and \nchanged to CMO. He expired shortly thereafter with his family at \nhis bedside.\n\n# Dyspnea\n# Acute respiratory failure\nHis metastatic cancer was been progressive, but CT findings have \nbeen stable for the last 3 days at least. Mass effect on the \nairways is seen but is similar with likely some superimposed \nintraluminal debris. CTA ruled out PE. Consolidation consistent \nw/ bacterial PNA was not seen on CT, however it was possible \nthat there is a small post-obstructive PNA brewing and he \ndecompensated in the setting of such little lung reserve. WBC \nelevated but was on steroids. He had a fever to 100.6 in the ED \nbut none they noticed at home. Flu PCR negative and the rest of \nthe viral panel was pending. DDx also includes other viral lung \ninfections, chemotherapy side effect. Fungal lung infection \nincluding aspergillis infection is also a concern. Additionally \nhe sounded wheezy and may have a bronchospastic component to his \npresentation. Cortisol wnl, so less likely adrenal \ninsufficiency. ET tube suctioning frank blood, concerning for \nongoing hemorrhage from ___. He had worsening blood gases on \nthe ventilator despite steroids and ABX. The decision was made \nto extubate him and transition to CMO.\n\n# Lactic acidosis- Lactate elevated on arrival to 12.7, prior to \nan nebs, but started to downtrend and was about 7 after 5L \nfluids in the ED. It was possible that he had a component of \npoor perfusion or perhaps concentration of the lactate, because \nhe was never hypotensive prior to the intubation. UOP was good \nand he was on a small amount of levophed. Albuterol nebs likely \ncontributed to the uptrend in the lactate after coming to the \nunit. The majority of this lactate elevation was likely type B \nlactic acidosis from malignancy. The pathogenesis is not well \nunderstood; anaerobic metabolism due to dense clusters of tumor \ncells and/or metastatic replacement of the hepatic parenchyma \nhas been proposed. Thiamine could have been contributing.\n\n# Metastatic renal cell carcinoma on axitinib (D1 ___ and \nnivolumab (C1D1 ___. LDH continued to climb which is \nconcerning for progressing malignancy.

She had completed a 14-day \ncourse of IV ceftriaxone for strep pneumo meningitis and was off \nall antibiotic therapy. She was still having constant headaches \nand was discharged on a prednisone burst, prophylactic \ngabapentin, and abortive reglan, tramadol, and ibuprofen. During \nthe past five days her headache has continued basically \nunchanged; about a ___, occipital headache with nausea, \nphotophobia and phonophonia. She has been spending most of her \ntime on the couch, and is taking all of her PRN medications \naround the clock (ibuprofen q8, tramadol q6, gabapentin TID, \nreglan/Benadryl q8) with minimal improvement. She has not had \nany new symptoms and she has been able to eat three meals a day \nwith snacks and is drinking Gatorade. Given her persistent \nsymptoms, ___ was to follow up with her PCP tomorrow and her \nneurologist and ID docs the day after. However, last night she \nstarted to feel very cold and her temperature was 101, so she \npresented to the ED. In addition to the headache she endorses \nsome recent neck soreness but has no other infectious symptoms.\n\nMs. ___ recent course is excellently summarized in Dr. ___ \n___ admission note on ___. Briefly, she presented to ___ \n___ with fever to 102.4 on ___ in the setting of a \nthrobbing, holocephalic headache which had persisted the past \nthree days. In the setting of her congenital brain \nmalformations, she was transferred to ___ for neurosurgical \nevaluation. No intervention was performed, but LP was deferred \ngiven concern for crowding of the foramen magnum. She had a \nleukocytosis to 29.6 with left shift and blood cultures were \npositive for strep pneumo and she was empirically treated for \nstrep pneumo meningitis. She was discharged with a midline and a \nplan to complete 14 days of IV ceftriaxone from the last \nnegative blood culture. Unfortunately, she had persistent \nheadache and returned to ___. She was seen in \nNeurology Clinic at ___ on ___ and was admitted to the \nGeneral Neurology service. During that admission, she underwent \nMRI/MRV which showed a hypoplastic left transverse sinus; she \nwas briefly on a heparin gtt for CVST which was stopped after it \nwas clear that the left transverse sinus was patent. A repeat LP \nwas performed which showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis with normal \nprotein and glucose which was thought to be consistent with \nresolving infection. She did have a urine culture which was \npositive for VRE in the setting of a normal UA and no symptoms; \nthis was thought to be a contaminant and was not treated. During \nher hospitalization she completed her planned 14-day course of \nceftriaxone. She started a prednisone burst (60 mg for five \ndays) and was discharged home on gabapentin with several choices \nof abortive therapies and a warning to avoid medication overuse.\n\nShe does have a history of continuous severe headache in ___ \nwhich lasted for two months, was unresponsive to all abortive \nagents, and resolved slowly after starting gabapentin. The \netiology of that episode remains unclear.\n \nPast Medical History:\n- Strep pneumo bacteremia and meningitis (presumed), ___, s/p \nCeftriaxone x7 days\n- Agenesis of the corpus callosum, colpocephaly, and Chiari \nmalformation\n- Headaches, migraines\n- Hammer toes s/p surgical repair\n \nSocial History:\n___\nFamily History:\nSisters x2 with Cystic Fibrosis; (patient is a carrier)\n \nPhysical Exam:\nADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:\n========================\nT:101.6; HR147; BP 131/80; RR 16; SpO2 96% RA \nGeneral: Thin girl, lying in bed with icepack on her head, in a\ndarkened room.

The patient was \ninitially started on vancomycin, cefepime and acyclovir due to \nconcern for bacterial or viral meningitis, but due to clinical \nstability the antibiotics were discontinued on ___ and the \npatient remained without fevers or systemic signs of infection \nfor the remainder of hospitalization. \n\nShe had persistent, ___ headaches during the course of \nhospital stay. The headaches persisted despite NSAIDs, triptans, \nmetoclopramide, diphenhydramine, lorazepam, high-dose narcotics, \ngabapentin, tramadol, dexamethasone, IV valproate, IV Magnesium, \nand cyclobenzaprine. Chronic pain was consulted in-house and \nperformed greater occipital, supraorbital, and auriculotemporal \nnerve blocks, which provided no relief.\n\nDue to the fact that the patient showed no other signs of \ninfection (despite a mild leukocytosis, which was downtrending \nby day of discharge) it was determined that it would be safe for \nher to be discharged home with close outpatient follow-up for \ncontinued pain control. She should follow up with \nneurology/headache clinic ASAP after discharge.\n\n=============\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n=============\n\n# FEVERS, LEUKOCYTOSIS S/P S. PNEUMO MENINGITIS:\nInitially admitted with new/recrudesced fevers at home after \nfully treatment with ceftriaxone, noted to have leukocytosis on \nadmission. Afebrile since antibiotics discontinued. Leukocytosis \ninitially resolved after discontinuation of antibiotics, but WBC \ncount increasing again on ___. Patient with underlying \nstructural neurologic deformities and recent history concerning \nfor Strep pneumo meningitis s/p empiric ceftriaxone. Patient has \nre-presented with the same symptoms she has had over the course \nof the past month with the addition of recurrence of high grade \nfevers. Most recent CSF showed lymphocytic predominance. Concern \nfor incompletely treated bacterial meningitis (perhaps due to \nunusual anatomy) vs. new meningitis (possibly introduced by tap \nor secondary infection) vs. separate source entirely. She was \ninitially empirically re-treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, \nand acyclovir; patient defervesced and WBC count normalized, and \nantimicrobials were discontinued. Patient remained afebrile and \nwithout signs of infection. No evidence of active or reactivated \ninfection was found. The patient was discharged on no \nantimicrobial therapy.\n\n# HEADACHE: Persistent headache with photophobia has been \nongoing since initial presentation with meningitis. Has been \nrefractory to multiple medications, including hydromorphone 2mg \nIV, NSAIDs, triptans, metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, \nlorazepam, high-dose narcotics, gabapentin, tramadol, \ndexamethasone, IV valproate, IV Magnesium, and cyclobenzaprine. \nChronic pain was consulted in-house and performed greater \noccipital, supraorbital, and auriculotemporal nerve blocks, \nwhich provided no relief. Discharged on topiramate, gabapentin, \ncitalopram, tramadol 100mg q.6H prn. Also discharged with \nCyclobenzaprine 5mg PRN in morning and lunch, 10mg PRN at \nbedtime and lorazepam PRN at bedtime, which helped the patient \nsleep.\n\nNotably, had a period of severe recurrent headaches during teen \nyears, the worst of which lasted for 2 months. These had \nresolved with Citalopram plus Gabapentin. She was able to \ndiscontinue these meds and has not needed them again for several \nyears.  \n\n# Sinus Opacification: Notes that she had sinus problems in \n___, and saw a physician who noted purulence of sinuses \nand recommended CT scan, which showed a completely opacified \nleft maxillary sinus. ENT was consulted who recommended afrin \nnasal spray x3 days followed by fluticasone nasal spray x6 \nweeks. There is no indication for invasive intervention on \nsinuses and it was felt that this sinus issue would be likely to \ncause her headaches or continued infectious symptoms.\n\n# Macrocytic anemia: Noted incidentally on labs. Unclear if this \nhas been worked up in past. Possibly megaloblastic in the \nsetting of Vitamin B12/Folate deficiency vs. medication effect. \nTSH normal. B12, Folate levels within normal limits. Further \nworkup of this macrocytic anemia is deferred to her outpatient \nproviders.\n\nEMERGENCY CONTACT HCP:  ___ (mother) ___   \nOther Phone: ___\nCODE STATUS: Full Code\n\n=====================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n=====================\n[] Patient to follow up with ___ for \ncontinued outpatient management\n[] Patient to follow up with Chronic Pain Anesthesia; attending \nfor follow up is Dr. ___ (___).\n[] Patient has PCP ___ ___.\n[] Patient was re-started on citalopram 10 mg daily, which she \nhas taken in the past.\n[] Other new medications: \n- Gabapentin 600mg TID\n- Tramadol 100mg q.6H PRN\n- Lorazepam 1mg QHS PRN\n- Cyclobenzaprine 10mg QHS PRN\n- Cyclobenzaprine 5mg in morning and midday PRN\n- Topiramate 25mg QD\n- Fluticasone 50mcg IN 2 sprays qd\n- Riboflavin 100mg QD\n- Ondansetron 4mg ODT q.8H\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nAcetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain\nDiphenhydrAMINE 12.5 mg PO Q6H:PRN headache \nFamotidine 20 mg PO DAILY (while on steroids).  \nGabapentin 800 mg PO TID\nIbuprofen 600 mg PO Q6H:PRN headache \nMetoclopramide 5 mg PO Q8H nausea \nPredniSONE 60 mg PO DAILY Duration: 3 Doses \nTraMADOL (Ultram) 50 mg PO Q6H:PRN breakthrough pain \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Please start ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day with food until \nfollow-up next week.\n\nIn short, you had a blockage in the pipes draining your \ngallbladder. This is bad because it puts you at risk of \ninfection and something called jaundice (yellowing of the eyes \nand skin). There were several attempts to open up this draining \nsystem, but were unsuccessful.\n\nWe discussed putting a drain outside of our body, but this would \ndrain the pipes away from your digestive system and cause you to \nlose much needed nutrients. Also, your pipes are not completely \nobstructed right now, they are only partially draining.\n\nYou also had findings that were concerning for primary \nsclerosing cholangitis (PSC). This is an auto-immune disease \n(where your immune system attacks your body) that is directed at \nyour draining system for your gallbladder. This is typically \nseen with a history of ulcerative colitis.

She remained afebrile until her operation. Blood and \nurine cultures were negative. \n\nOn ___, the patient underwent living donor liver transplant. \nPlease see operative report for further details. She required no \nblood products intra-op and remained intubated for admission to \nthe SICU post-op. Immediately post-op, she became \nhemodynamically unstable requiring increased doses of pressors \nbut her hematocrit was stable. A hepatic duplex demonstrated \npatency of all vascular anastomoses but absence of blood flow \nthrough the portal vein which necessitated immediate return to \nthe operating room for exploration. Compartment syndrome \nresolved by opening of the abdomen and placing a wound VAC. The \nnext day on ___, LFTs increased significantly and INR was \nelevated. She was taken back to the OR by Dr. ___ for \ndysfunctional liver and question of portal venous steal syndrome \nand probable immunologic rejection of liver graft with \ndysfunction. Intraop ultrasound was done showing that there was \nreversal of flow in the portal vein. Given concern for immune \nresponse contributing to edema and affect on blood flow, a \nsheath was placed in the mesenteric vein and ___ then performed a \ntrans-mesenteric portosystemic shunt occlusion and main portal \nveins stenting with restoration of hepatopetal flow into the \ntransplanted liver on ___. A liver biopsy was also \nperformed. Postop liver duplex on ___ demonstrated normal \nappearance of the right lobe liver with the portal venous flow \nreturned  to hepatopetal with a normal Doppler waveforms.  A \nheparin drip was started post ___ procedure. \n  \n\nGiven concern for immune process, she was given 3 doses of \nThymoglobulin (75mg each dose on ___. ALT/AST improved \nwith increased T.bili 9.1. Biopsy findings were consistent with \nischemic findings. \n\nOn ___, she returned to the OR for abdominal closure. The \nnext day, she exhibited signs of seizure activity. Neuro consult \nwas obtained and an EEG was done. This showed findings \nconsistent with encephalopathy. CT showed no intracranial \nprocess and Keppra was started. Head MRI was then done which was \nnegative for PRES.\n\nLFTs remained elevated. Repeat liver duplex demonsrated right \nhepatic vein stenosis. She was placed on a two week course of \nVanco and ___ for concern for cholangitis. LFTs improved. On  \n\nA post pyloric feeding tube was placed for malnutrition and free \nwater flushes were given for hypernatremia with improvement.

Cellcept was change to \n500mg qid with some improvement. \n\nShe was extubated on ___. Mental status was slow to improve. \nLFTs were still elevated with t.bili of 16 and rising WBC up to \n35. Blood and urine cultures were sent and all were negative. An \nabdominal/pelvic CT was done with finding of an SMV thrombus. \nHeparin drip was increased with goal of 60-80. A gravity \ncholangiogram was done on ___ which showed no \nleaks/obstruction or stricture. The Broviac tube was capped. On \n___, an MRI of the liver demonstrated volume of 1716 cm3, \npreviously 1539 cm3; thrombus RHV.   \n\nThe JP drain output continued to be high 600-800cc/day. \nCellcount on this fluid was negative. Albumin was given \nscheduled ATC. A wound VAC was applied to the incision with \nscheduled changes.  The  On ___,  2 units of pRBC were giveb \nfor a Hct of 19.6. Hep gtt was held and repeat Hct was 30.8. \nHeparin gtt was resumed. Another 2 units of prbc were given on \n___ for hct of 22. Of note, she was on ASA/Plavix and heparin \ndrip. \n\nOn ___, ___ and ___ were stopped. Fluc was started. She had \nsome BRBPR on  ___ with finding of abrasion on ext \nhemorrhoid,no active bleed with stable hct of 22.7, Heparin drip \nwas held for a day then resumed. She also had 2 days where the \nwound bled requiring a suture with resolution. VAC was \nreapplied.  \n\nOn ___, a liver biopsy was performed.

During your hospitalization, you had surgery to \nremove unhealthy tissue on your lower extremity.  You tolerated \nthe procedure well and are now ready to be discharged from the \nhospital.   Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a \nspeedy and uneventful recovery.\n\nLOWER  EXTREMITY AMPUTATION \nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS\nACTIVITY \n\u0095You should keep your amputation site elevated and straight \nwhenever possible.  This will prevent swelling of the stump and \nmaintain flexibility in your joint.  \n\u0095It is very important that you put no weight or pressure on \nyour stump with activity or at rest to allow the wound to heal \nproperly. \n\u0095You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots, if \napplicable.  It will take time to learn to use a walker and \nlearn to transfer into and out of a wheelchair.  \n\nMEDICATION\n\u0095Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all \nthe medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you \nnormally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not \ntake is on the list please discuss it with the team!  \n\n\u0095You will likely be prescribed narcotic pain medication on \ndischarge which  can be very constipating.  If you take \nnarcotics,  please also take a stool softener such as Colace.   \nIf constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest \nan additional over the counter laxative. \n\n\u0095You should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for \npain.  If this is not enough, take your prescription narcotic \npain medication.  You should require less pain medication each \nday.  Do not take more than a daily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.  \nTylenol is used as an ingredient in some other over-the-counter \nand prescription medications.  Be aware of how much Tylenol you \nare taking in a day.\n\nBATHING/SHOWERING: \n\u0095You may shower when you feel strong enough but no tub baths or \npools until you have permission from your surgeon and the \nincision is fully healed.\n\u0095After your shower, gently dry the incision well.   Do not rub \nthe area. \n\nWOUND CARE:\n\u0095Please keep the wound clean and dry. It is very important that \nthere is no pressure on the stump.    If there is no drainage, \nyou may leave the incision open to air.  \n\u0095Your staples/sutures will remain in for at least 4 weeks.  At \nyour followup appointment, we will see if the incision has \nhealed enough to remove the staples. \n\u0095Before you can be fitted for prosthesis (a man-made limb to \nreplace the limb that was removed) your incision needs to be \nfully healed. \n\nCALL THE OFFICE FOR: ___\n\u0095Opening, bleeding or drainage or odor from your stump incision \n\n\u0095Redness, swelling or warmth in your stump.\n\u0095Fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, or worsening \nincisional/stump pain  \n\nNO OTHER PROVIDER, EXCEPT YOUR VASCULAR SURGEON, SHOULD \nDETERMINE IF YOUR STAPLES ARE READY TO BE REMOVED FROM YOUR \nSTUMP!   \nIF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, THE PROVIDER SHOULD CALL THE \nVASCULAR SURGERY OFFICE AT ___ TO DISCUSS.   THE \nSTAPLES WILL BE REMOVED IN THE OFFICE AT YOUR FOLLOWUP \nAPPOINTMENT WHEN IT IS DETERMINED BY THE VASCULAR SURGEON THAT \nTHE WOUND HAS SUFFICIENTLY HEALED.\n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n\n \nName:  ___                     Unit No:   ___\n \nAdmission Date:  ___              Discharge Date:   ___\n \nDate of Birth:  ___             Sex:   M\n \nService: NEUROSURGERY\n \nAllergies: \nNo Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions\n \nAttending: ___.\n \nChief Complaint:\nACA aneurysm\n \nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\n___ - Midline craniotomy for clipping of distal ACA \naneurysm\n\n \nHistory of Present Illness:\n___ is a ___ gentleman who was involved\nwith radio ___.  He smoked in the past, but there were many\nyears where he was not a heavy smoker.  \n\nOn ___, he developed right head pain and headache.  This\npersisted for few days, and he ultimately sought medical\nattention.  A CT scan was done, which showed no evidence of\nhemorrhage.  However, a CT with contrast was performed and have\navailable a sagittal and axial reconstruction.  Sagittal\nreconstruction quite clearly shows a distal anterior cerebral\nartery aneurysm, which is approximately 4 mm in diameter.  I had\na long discussion with the patient and his wife regarding the\nnatural history of aneurysms, including treatment options of\nendovascular and surgical management.  The size of 4 mm with\napparent vessels in this location are quite small in the order \nof\n2 mm and therefore consideration for treatment would be given. \nThe treatment options for this lesion would include open \nsurgical\nclipping and endovascular coiling.  \n\nI do plan to review the films in more detail at our \nneurovascular\ngroup here at the ___ Brain Aneurysm Institute.  It may well \nbe\nthat an angiogram would be necessary to better define the\nthree-dimensional anatomy of lesion especially its relationship\nto the parent vessels within the neck to determine whether \nindeed\nthe direct coiling or stent-assisted coiling would be necessary\nfor aneurysm obliteration.  The patient seemed to have a good\noverall understanding of the situation.  \n\nHe had no focal neurologic deficits on today's evaluation.  He\nand his wife both had excellent questions, which I tried to\nanswer to the best of my abilities.  Please let me know if there\nis any further information I can provide for you at this point \nin\ntime and thank you again for your kind referral.\n \nPast Medical History:\nArthritis\nGout\nReflux, on omeprazole\nHypertension\ns/p synovectomy of knees bilaterally\ns/p tonsillectomy\ns/p andenoidectomy \n \nSocial History:\n___\nFamily History:\nNC\n \nPhysical Exam:\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:\n\nExam:\n\nOpens eyes: [x]spontaneous [ ]to voice [ ]to noxious\n\nOrientation: [x]Person [x]Place [x]Time\n\nFollows commands: [ ]Simple [x]Complex [ ]None\n\nPupils:  4-3mm bilaterally      EOM: [x]Full [ ]Restricted\n\nFace Symmetric: [x]Yes [ ]NoTongue Midline: [x]Yes [ ]No\n\nPronator Drift [ ]Yes [x]No     Speech Fluent: [x]Yes [ ]No\n\nComprehension intact [x]Yes [ ]No\n\nMotor:\nTrapDeltoidBicepTricepGrip\n\nIPQuadHamATEHLGast\n\n[x]Sensation intact to light touch\n\nWound: \n          [x]Incision Clean, dry, intact\n          [x]Sutures \n         \n\n \nPertinent Results:\nPlease see OMR for pertinent lab and imaging results. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n#Distal ACA aneurysm\nThe patient was taken to the operating room on the day of \nadmission, ___ and underwent a Midline craniotomy for \nclipping of distal ACA aneurysm.

Volume overload with pulmonary edema and bl effusions \n(possibly more chronic) in the setting of known AS, HTN, afib \nand receiving post-op mIVF. Responded to 20 IV Lasix boluses, \nthen later 20 PO boluses. CTA negative for PE. She clinically \ndoes not have COPD (lifelong non-smoker, no PFTs, no \nradiographic evidence) and no PFTs were completed to the patient \nand her daughter\u0092s knowledge but patient/family said was given \nthat diagnosis. Pt with tenuous volume status and will be sent \nto rehab with 20 mg PO furosemide PRN.\n\n# Aortic Stenosis\n#HTN\nSlowly resumed home afterload reducing agents given narrow fluid \nwindow. Per ___ team, patient's amlodipine was being held prior \nto her admission, so they did not think she needed to continue \nthis medication. However, her blood pressure was controlled 5mg \nPO lisinopril and 5mg PO amlodipine.\n\n# Afib: \nThe patient was on metoprolol succinate 25 mg PO daily at home \nand this was increased to 37.5mg daily due to poor rate control. \nUptitration was conservative given her aortic stenosis and \npreload dependence. She was not on anticoagulation at home.\n\n# Nutrition:\nFailed bedside SLP evaluation. She is on a dysphagia diet, and \nthe risk of aspirating in the setting of her code status change \nto DNR/DNI was explained to family. Pt was at times \nhypernatremic, thought to be due to decreased PO intake.\n\n# Delirium: \nMild dementia at baseline, hospital-associated delirium. \nGeriatrics followed and thought that the patient became closer \nto baseline upon discharge so we gave trazaone 25mg qhs and \navoided benzodiazepines. \n\n# s/p ORIF: Patient presented after an unwitnessed fall. She was \nfound to have a left periprosthetic femur fracture and was \nadmitted to the orthopedic surgery service on ___. On ___, the \npatient was taken to the operating room for left proximal femur \nopen reduction internal fixation, which the patient tolerated \nwell. She did not complain of pain post procedure and had good \ncontrol with lidocaine patch, oxycodone, and standing Tylenol. \nShe was discharged with WBAT. She was on DVT ppx with lovenox 30 \nsc daily. ___ consulted and recommended discharge to rehab. She \nwill follow up with Dr. ___ in orthopedics in 2 weeks.\n\n# Macrocytic anemia\nUnknown baseline, stable over admission. On ___, one day after \nher surgery, she had a decrease in her H/H likely contribution \nfrom surgery. Ferritin was high so likely ACD as Vit B12 and \nfolate WNL. \n\n# Enterococcus urine cx\nAsymptomatic and no WBC on ua so did not treating. \n\n# Code: DNR/DNI confirmed with her daughter/HCP. \n\nORTHO COURSE:\n===============\nThe patient presented to the emergency department and was \nevaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found \nto have a left periprosthetic femur fracture and was admitted to \nthe orthopedic surgery service on ___. A Geriatric consult was \nobtained and recommendations were provided for guidance in \nmanaging agitation/delirium. On ___, the patient was taken to \nthe operating room for left proximal femur open reduction \ninternal fixation, which the patient tolerated well. For full \ndetails of the procedure please see the separately dictated \noperative report. Of note, the patient was given 2 units of \npRBCs in the OR. The patient was taken from the OR to the PACU \nin stable condition. She was extubated successfully in the PACU, \nand after satisfactory recovery from anesthesia she was \ntransferred to the floor. The patient was given ___ \nantibiotics and anticoagulation per routine. On POD1, CBC \nrevealed a decreased H/H. BMP revealed an elevation in \nCreatinine, and the patient was noted to have poor UOP during \nthe morning. Her blood pressures dropped to the ___ and she \nwas evaluated urgently by the team. Other vital signs were \nstable, and she was able to relay to the team that she felt \nokay, with assistance from her daughter at the bedside. Stat \nCBC, BMP, EKG, and a 250cc fluid bolus were ordered. EKG did not \nvary from baseline on ___, and repeat H/H was improved. Repeat \nBMP revealed further increase in Creatinine, and the patient's \nIVFs were increased. \n\nMICU COURSE ___\n============================\nPatient started complaining of SOB ___ around 8 ___. It was an \nacute change, no breathing difficulties earlier in admission. \nSOB has remained constant since that time. She has carried a \ndiagnosis of COPD since early this year, but family denies pt \never having PFTs done and she is a never smoker. Uses ___ home \nO2 intermittently at night. On arrival to the MICU, she was \nintermittently complaining of SOB. She had a CTA done given \nimmobilization and procedure, and ruled out for PE. she was \nstarted to be diuresed with improvement, received IV Lasix 20x2 \nwith urine output. Bedside ultrasound showed simple effusions, \nbut to minimize procedures and small pockets, diuresis was \npursued. Pain management done with Tylenol and oxycodone as \nneeded. Quetiapine used for intermittent delirium. For atrial \nfibrillation, higher dose of metoprolol XL 37.5 instead of 25 \nfor better heart rate control, home antihypertensives resumed to \nhelp with afterload given known aortic stenosis and pulmonary \nhypertension. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n====================\n[ ] Please weight patient daily and follow up volume status.

She was started on low dose metoprolol which was \nultimately uptitred to 75mg succinate daily. She was started on \na heparin gtt, however, after a subsequent event of SVT, it was \nnoted that she was in MAT, not atrial fibrillation, and thus she \nwould not require ongoing anticoagulation. Thus her heparin gtt \nwas discontinued and she was discharged on metoprolol for \ncontinued rate control.\n\n# Septic Shock: \nPatient with signs of septic shock, and chest radiograph with \nevidence of consolidative process in the right lower lobe. CXR \n___ with improvement in RLL ?pleural effusion s/p UF but stable \nscattered consolidations concerning for multifocal PNA. Pressor \nrequirement resolved by ___ in the MICU required \nlevophed).

Her \ncourse was complicated by worsening hypoxia following extubation \nwhich required re-intubation after failure on non-invasive \nventilation. She then worsened on the vent with max settings and \na CXR consistent with pulmonary edema. A bronch was performed \nwhich demonstrated moderate amount of clear frothy liquid \nconsistent with a pulmonary edema picture. Ultimately she \nrequired paralysis for better synchrony with the vent.

The brain is the part of your body that \ncontrols and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage \nto the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result \nin a variety of symptoms.\n\nStroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for \nmedical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. \nIn your case, you were found to have a clot in the one of the \nmajor arteries to your brain, this is likely because of the \nradiation you had for treatment of your cancer / abnormal lymph \nnodes. We attempted to do a procedure to retrieve the clot, \nhowever this was unable to be completed. You were monitored in \nthe ICU for many days. You were seen by the physical therapy and \nspeech teams as well. Ultimately you were still having a lot of \ntrouble swelling so you had a feeding tube (PEG) placed in your \nstomach so you could receive nutrition. You were also treated \nfor a pneumonia while you were in the hospital. \n\nWe are changing your medications as follows:\n- Started atorvastatin 80mg \n- Aspirin 81mg \n- Amlodipine 10mg \n\nPlease take your other medications as prescribed.\n\nPlease follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician \nas listed below.\n\nIf you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek \nemergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical \nServices (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, \nplease pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of \nthese symptoms:\n- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision\n- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth\n- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to \nyou\n- Sudden weakness of one side of the body\n- Sudden drooping of one side of the face\n- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body\n\nSincerely,\nYour ___ Neurology Team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n\n",

At 10 AM when his MAC anaesthesia was started his\nspeech was normal. The procedure was extended due to difficulty\nplacing the port, but there was no evidence of puncture of any\narterial structures. CXR afterwards confirmed the port position\nin the correct spot. When waking up he was initially very sleepy\nand didn't say much. However. around 2PM as he was getting his\ndischarge instructions with his daughter, he started to speak\nmore and his speech output was abnormal. He was saying correct\nbut inappropriate words. His nurse assessed his strength and he\nwas able to understand (with mimicing) and perform pronator \ndrift\nand grasp testing without deficits. However, he would answer\nquestions only with stock phrases and called his daughter by his\nwife's name and so a code stroke was called at 1430. He was out\nof the tPA window and there was no evidence of intervenable\nlesion on CTA and so no intervention was performed. Since that\ntime he has spiked a fever to 101.3.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr. ___ has progressive, unresectable prostate\nadenocarcinoma with evidence of metastasis to the liver. It was\nfirst diagnosed six weeks ago when he presented to an OSH on \n___\nwith epigastric pain, bloating and numbness.He has recently\nundergone multiple procedures, including: ___ liver biopsy; \n___\nERCP with brushings, stent replacement, and celiac plexus\nneurolysis.

He drives, cooks, dresses himself. He goes to the gym\nfrequently. He is out of work and has been looking for a job. \nPer\nreview of the chart, however, Mr. ___ also has problems with\nchronic cancer pain as well as chronic lower back pain.

Etiology thought to be secondary \nto hypertension. He developed hydrocephalus with a worsening \nmental status exam requiring EVD placement on ___ with \nintrathecal TPA (5 doses total). He was also transfused with 1U \nplatelets. He had resultant improvement in his mental status. \nEVD was pulled ___ without complication. His aspirin was held \nduring the admission and may be resumed on discharge. Throughout \nhis admission, his mental status was waxing and waning - some \ndays he was more oriented with more intelligible speech. Other \ndays, he was disoriented with mumbling but always able to follow \nsimple commands. Head CTs were repeated in the setting of these \nfluctuations and were confirmed no change in his bleed with no \ndevelopment of hydrocephalus. \n\n# Hypertension\nVery difficult to control, requiring treatment with HCTZ, \ncaptopril, amlodipine, hydralazine, isosorbide dinitrate. Workup \nfor secondary hypertension: Renal artery ultrasound \nunremarkable; plasma aldosterone and renin activity also WNL. \nFurther outpatient evaluation may be considered with further \nadjustment of antihypertensives. \n\n# Dysphagia \nInitially required NG tube and repeatedly failed swallow \nevaluations. PEG tube was placed ___ without complication. \n\n# Bradycardia\nTelemetry notable for intermittent asymptomatic bradycardia as \nwell as significant first-degree heart block, with occasional \nruns of Mobitz I second-degree block. Note was also made of \noccasional blocked PACs from an ectopic focus.

As a result of your bleed, you have some \nconfusion, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, weakness and \nsensory loss in your right arm and leg. You required an \nextraventricular drain for some time because the bleeding was \ncausing some increased pressure in your head. This was \neventually taken out because you no longer needed it. You had \ntrouble swallowing due the bleed and required placement of a PEG \ntube so that you could keep up with your nutrition. You can \ncontinue trials taking food by mouth at your rehab center. \n\nYou had difficult to control high blood pressure while admitted. \nWe started several new medications to control this.\n\nMEDICATION CHANGES\n- Increased HCTZ to 50mg daily\n- Started amlodipine 10mg daily\n- Started captopril 150mg three times/day\n- Started hydralazine 20mg every 6 hours\n- Stopped aspirin\n- Stopped Isosorbide mononitrate\n- Started Isosorbid Dinitrate 40mg three times/day\n- Stopped lisinopril\n\nWe hope that as you are more mobile with physical therapy at \nrehab, you will need less blood pressure medication. You \nunderwent some testing for secondary causes of hypertension \nwhich were unrevealing, so you will likely need additional \ntesting at your follow-up visits with your cardiologist. \n\nYou will need to follow up with your primary care provider to \nhelp manage your blood pressure. Please schedule this after \ndischarge from the rehab. You should follow up with neurology as \nbelow. \n\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.\n\n___ Neurology Team \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n\n \nName:  ___                    Unit No:   ___\n \nAdmission Date:  ___              Discharge Date:   ___\n \nDate of Birth:  ___             Sex:   M\n \nService: ORTHOPAEDICS\n \nAllergies: \nNo Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions\n \nAttending: ___.\n \nChief Complaint:\nRight lateral ankle wound with exposed bone and tendon, now \nstatus post ankle fusion.  \n\n \nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\n1.

Will follow up with vascular surgery \nin 2 weeks (Dr. ___ and outpatient ID appointments as \ndecided based on weekly labs to OPAT. Will need wound vac placed \non the site until follow up appointment. \n\n# ?Acute Encephalopathy, likely Toxic Metabolic, in setting of \nchronic early dementia: Found to be hallucinating and not AOX3 \non admission. Likely secondary to infection of the RLE stump in \nthe setting of underlying dementia. Symptoms occurred on \nadmission and  improved w/ abx therapy. No recurrence of \nsymptoms during the rest of the hospitalization. He was \ncontinues on home Olanzapine during stay.\n\n# T2DM, insulin dependent:  patient was diagnosed with diabetes\ninitially during hospitalization in ___ for amputation.\nSuboptimal DM2 management in house secondary to frequent NPO for\npossible surgery. He was admitted on Lantus 9u QHS but required \nLantus 45U QHS and standing 5U with meals plus SS by discharge \nto manage fasting glucose to ideal levels. Will decrease his \nLantus to 40U on discharge given concern for hypoglycemia with \ntoo strict of management but will continue with standing 5U \nHumalog with meals as well as SS.

Sensitive to\nzosyn which he started getting for osteomyelitis treatment of \nthe RLE stump..\n___ have also contributed to TME and septic physiology upon \narrival.  \n\n # Hypertension: Anti-hypertensive medications (amlodipine, \nLisinopril, and Carvedilol were held on admission due to \ninfection. Medications were restarted later but patient remain \nhypertensive despite maximum triple therapy for HTN. Will need \nto evaluate oupatient with PCP for further management. \n-------\n\nChronic issues:\n # Anemia: Baseline Hgb most recently around 10, remains stable\nat 8 today. No evidence of active bleeding. Most likely anemia\n___ inflammation. Did not require transfusions.\n\n # Severe Malnutrition: Albumin 3.1, INR 1.4 from presumed\nvitamin K deficiency. Nutrition was consulted and his PO intake \nwas increased. He tolerated a regular diet well.  \n \n # H/O Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease: patient with baseline\nconfusion but acutely worsened on admission in the setting of \ninfection and improved after abx. Continued home olanzapine. \nDiscontinued home ropinirole given it was being used for phantom \npain but believe the pain is related to the AKA infection \n\n # CKD (Stage 2, GFR 69, CrCl 59): likely from DM and HTN. At\nbaseline Cr throughtout hospitalization. \n\n# Hyperlipidemia: Held home fenofibrate given CKD \n\n------\nTransitional Issues: \n1.

Left subclavian vein and proximal SVC are not well assessed \nalong the course of the pacemaker leads and there is artifact \nfrom the pacer leads. Patency of these portions of the vessel \ncannot be confirmed on this study.  No definite contrast is seen \nalong the proximal to mid left subclavian and proximal svc, \nwhich may be chronically occluded.  No thrombus within the right \natrium.  Multiple collateral vessels are seen.\n2. Patent right IJ.  Left IJ not visualized, may be very \nattenuated chronically, chronically occluded comparison with \nprior study would be helpful. \n3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism up to the lobar level or \naortic abnormality. \n4. Multifocal pneumonia with ground-glass opacities within right \nupper and left lower lobes. 3 cm hypodensity along right major \nfissure may represent loculated pleural fluid or less likely \nfat, lipoid pneumonia not excluded. 5.  Limited evaluation of \nthe neck demonstrates peritracheal soft tissue swelling and \nconcern for retropharyngeal edema.  The airway is patent. \nConsider neck CT for better assessment. \n6.  Small pericardial effusion. \n7.  1.7 cm left thyroid nodule.  If indicated and not previously \nassessed consider nonurgent thyroid ultrasound for further \nevaluation. \n\nBilateral Upper Extremity U/S - FINDINGS:  \nThere is normal flow with respiratory variation in the bilateral \nsubclavian veins. \nThe bilateral internal jugular veins contain non-occlusive \nthrombus of indeterminate age.  The right internal jugular vein \nis thick walled with slow flow within which may be indicative of \nmore chronic thrombus. The subclavian veins are patent \nbilaterally. \nThe right brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins are patent and \ncompressible. \nIMPRESSION:  \nNonocclusive thrombus in the bilateral internal jugular veins. \n\nTTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated. A density in the \nposterior right atrium likely represents prominent eustachian \nvalve. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are \nnormal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF \n= 45-50 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal \n(>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left \nventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right \nventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free \nwall function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus \nlevel. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not \npresent. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve \nprolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial \npericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with borderline \nright and mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function. \nMildly dilated thoracic aorta. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild \npulmonary hypertension. \n\nLLE U/S - IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in \nthe left lower extremity veins. Peripheral nonocclusive thrombus \n(of indeterminate age) or wall thickening in a \nsuperficial/varicose vein along the popliteal fossa \n\nCXR (___) - IMPRESSION:  \nNo previous images.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and there is \nindistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels consistent with \nelevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification \nwith poor definition of the hemidiaphragms consistent with \nvolume loss in left lower lobe and pleural fluid.  Dual-chamber \npacer device is in place with leads in the right atrium and \nright ventricle. \n\nCXR (___) -  IMPRESSION:  \nPacemaker and its leads are in unchanged position.  Right upper \nlobe consolidation is re- demonstrated, concerning for \npneumonia.  No pulmonary edema demonstrated.  No appreciable \npleural effusion seen.  There is no pneumothorax. \n\nRight Fool X-rays  \nIMPRESSION: No evidence of acute bone or joint space \nabnormality.  Of incidental note is vascular calcification about \nthe lower leg and ankle. \n  \n\nRight Foot U/S - IMPRESSION:  \nNo acute process identified in the region of the dorsal lateral \nright foot, in the area of pain.  Specifically, no suspicious \nfluid collection or soft tissue swelling.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ y/o M with PMHx of sCHF, 3rd degree heart block s/p PPM, and \nrecent RIJ thrombus, who presented to ___ with SOB and \ncough concerning for CHF exacerbation vs PNA and was also found \nto have a new left-sided thrombus. Hematology was consulted. He \nis on Lovenox for the thrombus. Treated with abx for PNA. Course \nalso notable for persistent wheezing, attributed to reactive \nairways, improving with steroids and nebs.\n\n# Dyspnea: On presentation, dysphagia and audible wheezing were \ninitially concerning for upper airway obstruction likely from \noropharynx edema ___ venous thrombosis. He was evaluated by ENT \nwho was not concerened for a mass, and he was found to have \npossible retropharyngeal edema on chest CT. Patient was given \ndexamethasone 10mg IV. On the floor, the patient had difficulty \nbreathing with an increase O2 requirment from 4 to 5L and \ndiffuse wheezing on exam. He was given a duoneb and transfered \nto the ICU briefly. Ultimately, his shortness of breath was felt \nto be multifactorial. Pt had a pneumonia, for which he received \nan 8 day course of abx. There is also likely a component of \nairway inflammation contributing as well, given wheezing on \nexam. Treated with nebs, also started steroids ___ (last \nday ___. Finally, there may also have been a component of \nvolume overload contributing; although this seems less likely to \nstill be present given recent CXR and downtrending\nBNP. Propagation of known thrombi seems less likely given that \npatient is therapeutically anticoagulated at this time. \nRespiratory status much improved by the time of discharge.\n\n# Bialteral Internal Jugular Thromboses: He presented with a \nrecent history of thrombosis in R IJ. He now presented with \nthrombus in L IJ in setting of Coumadin with therapeutic INR \nalthough there is no prior study to compare with. R extremity is \nmarkedly edematous with R sided facial flushing and fullness. \nThere was initial concern for SVC syndrome; however, pt improved \nclinically. Ongoing clot formation raises concern for malignancy \ngiven that he was therapeutic on warfarin. Thromboses could also \nbe associated with pacer leads. Hematology involved. He was \ninitially placed on a heparin gtt and then trantioned to ___ \nper the Hematology consult recs. \n\n# Edema: Most notable in the upper extremities, R>L. Likely \nrelated to known clots. Improved with wrapping/elevating upper \nextremities.\n\n# PNA: Pt with evidence of multifocal PNA. There was a question \nof lipoid PNA per radiology read. Pt has been reporting \nconstipation, possible that he may have aspirated mineral oil. \nWas initially treated as HCAP given recent hospitalization with \nvanc/cefepime. However, given stable overall clinical picture as \nwell as absence of fever/leukocytosis, narrowed abx to \nCTX/azithro. He completed an 8 day course of antibiotics.\n\n# Dysphagia: Pt has had progressive dysphagia to both liquids \nand solids which is concerning for an upper airway obstruction. \nPossibly CA given h/o smoking (cigars and pipes ___ and \n___ esophagitis. ENT did an upper airway scope on ___ \nwhich was negative. Swallowing improved over the course of his \nhospitalization. Could consider formal swallow evaluation if any \nfurther complaints of dysphagia.\n\n# Orthostatic Hypotension: Per outpt records this is attributed \nto IJ/SVC clots leading to decreased pre-load. Could have \ncomponent of pacer dysynchrony. On midodrine and \nfludrocortisone.\n\n# Right Ankle Pain: Sudden onset during admission without \npreceding trauma. X-ray and u/s negative for acute process. Pain \nresolved spontaneously.\n\n# LLE Pain: Patient underwent LLE ultrasound and found to have \nthrombosed distended varicose vein on imaging. Superficial \nthrombophlebitis. Treating supportively.\n\n# CHB s/p PPM: No acute issues.\n# Hypothyroidism: On levothyroxine.\n# Thyroid Nodule: Seen on CT scan.

She also developed chorio and \nunderwent 24 hours of unasyn and clinda. \n\nOn PPD1, she developed fever, acute SOB, with desaturation to \n88% on RA requiring 02. She underwent a CTA to r/o PE. The CTA \nwas negative for PE, but did show bilateral pleural effusion, a \na possible consolidation and PNA could not be ruled out. Patient \ncontinued to be SOB with desaturations when off oxygen. The \ndecision was made to give IV lasix given her fluid overload \nstatus. Given the fever, her antibiotics were broaden to zosyn. \nBy POD2, the patient was weaned off 02 with 97% 02 saturation on \nRA. She was continued on zosyn and remained afebrile.

On POD3-4, patient remained afebrile, was ambulating \nwith out SOB or desaturations, was tolerating a regular diet, \nand her cellulitis was improving. She endorsed diarrhea and a \nc-diff was obtained which was negative. On POD4 she was \ntransitioned to PO augmentin. \n\nBy postpartum day 5, she was tolerating a regular diet, \nambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral \nmedications. She was afebrile with stable vital signs.

Cystic \nsubcentimeter pancreatic lesions, likely side-branch IPMNs, \naccording to guidelines, no further follow-up indicated. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n ___ with HTN, DM2, bicuspid AV c/b AS s/p mechanical aortic \nvalve on warfarin for mechanical valve, possible h/o CAD, \npresenting with headache and vomiting, ED course complicated by \nchest pain.  \n\n # Headache with vomiting: patient had LP that was not \nsuggestive of meningitis. His neuro imaging was negative for \ndissection, stroke or other acute process and only notable for \nmild atherosclerotic disease. Likely a migraine as it was \nshort-lived and he does have a history of migraines. He was \ntreated symptomatically with Tylenol. His headaches did not \nrecur during admission.  \n\n # Chest Pain, likely stable angina: patient with brief chest \npain that he describes as sharp pulsation but per report did \nhave dynamic EKG changes. While his pain does not sound cardiac \nin nature and there was no troponin elevation, this could be on \nACS spectrum (unstable angina) and may warrant stress testing vs \ncath given he is high risk. He has had this pain previously at \nhome. Repeat EKG was obtained on the floor and did not show \npreviously seen TWI in V4-V6. He was started on Metoprolol \n12.5mg daily for cardiac optimization; this should be increased \nas tolerated as an outpatient. He has an appointment with Dr. \n___ the week after discharge. His recurrent chest pain \nshould continue to be evaluated as an outpatient.\n\n # Recent bleeding with subtherapeutic INR: patient is \nanticoagulated and had bleeding at ___ injection site 2 days \nprior to admission. AC has been on held since then, self \ndiscontinued by patient/family. Bleeding has stopped, H/H stable \nwith subtherapeutic INR. Mechanical valves are high risk for \nembolic events. Lovenox 90mg SC BID, as well as Warfarin 5mg \ndaily, were resumed on ___. These should be continued after \ndischarge. Arrangements were made for him to be followed in the \n___ clinic. His goal INR is ___. INR prior to \ndischarge: 1.4 (___). Coumadin dose 5mg daily upon \ndischarge. \n\n # Hematuria. Had approx. 4 episodes of gross hematuria ___. No \nrecent Foley/instrumentation to explain this. Per pt, this is a \nnew problem. This self-resolved without intervention. Continue \nto monitor for this as an outpatient. \n \n # Diabetes, non-insulin dependent: Home oral agents were held \non admission, he was maintained on sliding scale insulin. Oral \nagents resumed upon discharge.\n \n # HTN: Continued home antihypertensives, with addition of \nMetoprolol as above. \n\n # CAD/ HLD: Continued home statin. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n=====================\n-Coumadin dose 5mg on discharge \n-Lovenox 90 mg SC BID to continue until INR > 2 for goal INR ___\n-patient must be bridged given mechanical valve\n-metoprolol 12.5 mg daily started consider uptitration\n-consider initiation of aspirin 81 mg once lovenox complete \ngiven history of coronary artery disease \n-INR on discharge: 1.4 (___)\n-INR to be managed by ___ clinic\n-Should have ___ lab draw ___ (INR).

There \nis no evidence of aortic dissection.  \n\nTransthoracic Echocardiogram ___\nOverall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF \n50%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with \ndepressed free wall contractility. Aortic regurgitation is \npresent, but cannot be quantified (most likely mild to moderate, \nbut this was not fully interrogated on this limited study and \nwould have been better assessed on the immediate post-op TEE \nimages). The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is \nnormal. There is a very small pericardial effusion. No right \natrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There is \naccentuated respiratory variation in mitral valve inflows, which \ncould be due to rapid changes in intrathoracic pressure at the \nrespiratory rate of 25/min measured on the respirometer. \n\nIMPRESSION: Very small pericardial effusion.\n.\n\n___ 04:44AM BLOOD WBC-8.7 RBC-2.94* Hgb-8.2* Hct-25.1* \nMCV-85 MCH-27.9 MCHC-32.7 RDW-14.5 RDWSD-45.1 Plt ___\n___ 05:38AM BLOOD WBC-6.5# RBC-2.93* Hgb-8.3* Hct-25.0* \nMCV-85 MCH-28.3 MCHC-33.2 RDW-14.4 RDWSD-44.8 Plt ___\n___ 05:55AM BLOOD ___\n___ 04:44AM BLOOD Glucose-82 UreaN-21* Creat-1.0 Na-143 \nK-3.9 Cl-101 HCO3-24 AnGap-18\n___ 06:30AM BLOOD Glucose-134* UreaN-16 Creat-0.9 Na-137 \nK-4.2 Cl-103 HCO3-25 AnGap-9*\n___ 04:44AM BLOOD Mg-2.3\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nHe was admitted on ___ for cardiac catheterization which \ndemonstrated no obstructive coronary artery disease.

On admission she was noted \nto have anemia with nadir to 21.9 pre-op. She received 1 unit \npRBCs pre-operatively with additional units held due to fever. \nOn post-op day one her Hct was 20.9 and she received an \nadditional unit pRBC with appropriate rise in Hct to 27.4. A \nchest x-ray performed on presentation identified a small to \nmoderate L pl effusion, pulm vascular congestion w/o \ninterstitial edema. She had an acute episode of oxygen \ndesaturation and difficulty breathing on HD#1 at the time of her \nacutely-worsened pain. A CTA chest was obtained and ruled out \nPE. Repeat CXR POD#1 showed stable L pleural effusion w/ \nsubsegmental atelectasis in LL base, trace R eff. She continued \nto have increased oxygen demands post-operatively and was placed \non continuous O2 monitoring which noted saturations in the low \n___ on RA at baseline with desaturations to as low as high ___ \nwhile sleeping. Desaturations were concerning for undiagnosed \nOSA and CPAP was ordered for remainder of her hospital stay. She \nalso received one dose of lasix for concern of pulmonary edema \ncontributing to her oxygen requirements. Repeat CTA chest on \n___ showed no PE but did identify multifocal PNA for which she \nwas started on Vancomycin empirically and narrowed to \ndoxycycline and levoquin. During her stay she also had multiple \nepisodes of severe HTN to >180/110s, requiring hydralazine for \nacute stabilization. Medicine was consulted and recommended she \nbe started on amlodipine 5 mg, then increased to 10 mg, daily. \nOf note, we also obtained an echocardiogram to evaluate for \nheart failure in the context of persistent tachycardia and low \nO2 sats. The TTE was wnl. \n\nBy post-operative day 4, she was tolerating a regular diet, \nambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral \nmedications.

You underwent surgery, which found \nthat the mass had caused your ovary to be twisted on itself. The \nmass involved your right ovary, and both were removed during \nyour operation. Our initial pathology report suggests that the \nmass is most likely benign (non-cancerous), but you will go over \nthe final report when you follow up in clinic with Dr. ___. \nAfter your procedure, there was concern about how well you were \nbreathing. We obtained a number of tests, including a CT scan of \nyour chest and an ultrasound of your heart, to evaluate what \nmight be causing your lower oxygen levels. These imaging studies \nnoted that there was some fluid on your lungs that might be \ncontributing to your breathing issues, but overall we suspect \nthis issue is related to sleep apnea. You have not previously \nbeen diagnosed with sleep apnea, and you will still need to be \nevaluated by a sleep medicine specialist to confirm this and \ntreat you. The imaging studies also identified a pneumonia, and \nyou were started on antibiotics to treat this. We will provide \nyou with antibiotics that you will continue to take for a few \ndays once you are home. Lastly, we had some concern about your \nhigh blood pressure and you were started on a daily medication \n(amlodipine) for this. Please continue to take this, and follow \nup with your PCP about your high blood pressure.\n\nOverall, you have recovered well and the team believes you are \nready to be discharged home. Please call Dr. ___ office with \nany questions or concerns. Please follow the instructions below.\n\nPlease make sure you contact your employer to obtain the \nnecessary paperwork to excuse you from work for the next 6 \nweeks. Please fax your forms to ___ and we will be able \nto fill it out for you.\n\nGeneral instructions:\n* Take your medications as prescribed.\n* Do not drive while taking opioids (e.g. oxycodone, \nhydromorphone)\n* Take a stool softener such as colace while taking opioids to \nprevent constipation.\n* Do not combine opioid and sedative medications or alcohol.\n* Do not take more than 4000mg acetaminophen (APAP) in 24 hrs.\n* No strenuous activity until your post-op appointment.\n* No heavy lifting of objects >10 lbs for 6 weeks. A letter was \nprovided for you to share with your employer to dismiss you from \nwork activities that require you to lift heavy objects.\n* You may eat a regular diet.\n* You may walk up and down stairs.\n\nIncision care:\n* You may shower and allow soapy water to run over incision; no \nscrubbing of incision.

If you are able to take \nTylenol (acetaminophen) I would strongly encourage you to do so \naccording to the instructions on the bottle. Do not take more \nthan 4,000 mg of Tylenol in 24 hours.\n- NSAIDs (Advil, Motrin, Aleve, etc) are also excellent for pain \ncontrol post-operatively. Do not take if you have had a bone \nfusion surgery, but for soft tissue procedures or most fracture \nsurgeries these medications are acceptable unless you are unable \nto take for other medical reasons or unless we have specifically \ninstructed you against it.\n- Elevation with the operative site above the level of the heart \nwill decrease swelling and improve pain control\n- Ice or cold therapy may also be helpful. Do not keep ice or \ncold directly on the skin and do not use for more than ___ \nminutes to decrease risk of skin injury from the cold. Do NOT \nuse ice when the block is still in effect as you will not know \nif you are injuring yourself. You may place the ice pack behind \nyour knee if you have a bulky dressing on your foot. \n- Every little bit helps. The faster you can come off the \nnarcotic medication the better. Most of my patients do not need \nnarcotics after the first post-operative visit!\n\n ACTIVITY:\n\n- You will likely have swelling after surgery. Please keep your \nleg elevated on ___ pillows at all times possible. You can apply \na dry, covered, ice-bag on top of your dressing or behind your \nknee for 20 minutes at a time as often as you like.\n- Unless instructed otherwise you should not put any weight down \non your operated extremity until you come back for your first \npostoperative visit.\n\n CARE FOR YOUR DRESSING:\n\n- You should continue wet to dry dressing changes daily and \nreturn for wound check in the clinic.\n- It is not unusual to have a little bloody staining through \nyour dressing. However please call the office for any concerns.\n- Keep your dressing clean. You will have to cover it when you \nbath or shower. If it gets wet please call the office \nimmediately.\n\n PREVENTION OF BLOOD CLOTS:\n\n- You have been instructed to take medication in order to help \nprevent blood clots after surgery.
