Transferred from the MICU to the medicine floor \non ___ given resolving sepsis likely from sacral wound. He was \nstable on the medicine floor with waxing and waning orientation \n(likely his new baseline) requiring intermittent dialysis, pain \nmedicine, and anti-itching medicine.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n=============\n#Intubation d/t mental status\n#Hypercarbic respiratory failure now resolved\n#Chronic Aspiration\nPatient intubated ___ for airway protection iso worsening \nmental status. Multifocal opacities on CT Chest concerning for \naspiration pneumonitis vs pneumonia.  Discussions with wife \nthroughout course indicated that he would want everything done \nincluding trach/PEG if necessary; however of note he would \nrequire C-surg d/t complicated anatomy. He had a prolonged \nintubation due to excessive  secretions and poor mental status. \nHe was able to be extubated ___ and did well. His diet was \nadvanced slowly which he tolerated well. Diet at discharge was \nsoft solids, thin liquids, with 1:1 supervision.\n\n#Toxic metabolic encephalopathy\n#Epileptiform discharges on EEG\n#Altered mental status\n#CVA - right middle cerebellar peduncle\nMental status was poor despite completing treatment for \ninfection above. EEG over multiple days not consistent with \nseizure like activity. MRI brain revealed small punctate infarct \nin right middle cerebellar peduncle; however, this is unlikely \nto explain mental status. MRA with patent circle of ___ \narteries. Patient received keppra 500 BID with extra 500 post \ndialysis on MWF. He received atorvastatin and ASA for CVA risk. \nPlavix was held in setting of bleeding. Neurology and vascular \nsurgery both agreed that Plavix can be discontinued. \n\n# ESRD on ___ HD: \nReceived CRRT due to hypotension; renal followed.

Fecal management system \n(flexiseal) placed to divert stool from open sacral wound and \nhelp with healing. Would need diverting colostomy for definitive \nwound repair, which wife states is absolutely NOT within GOC. \nWound care and ACS followed, recommended enzymatic debridement \nand ultimately placed wound vac. Plastic was not offering flap \nfor closure given comorbidities. On ___, pressor requirement and \nwhite count increased, started vanc/meropenem again given \nblue-green drainage from wound; wound culture grew pseudomonas. \nHe finished course of meropenem on ___. Patient also received \nstress dose steroids in the setting of sepsis. He remained \nstable without any other signs of infection through his hospital \nstay.\n\n# Anemia\n# Hematochezia \nChronic anemia due to renal disease, trended downward ___, with \nCT C/A/P without evidence of bleed. Stool dark and guiac \npositive making GI bleed most likely. Patient was too unstable \nat present to undergo scope. Had visualized melena and \nhematochezia earlier in admission iso likely hypotension/bowel \nischemia which had resolved but bleeding seems to have recurred \nwhile on asa/Plavix for CVA. Plavix was held and hemoglobin \nremained stable. Endoscopic evaluation was deferred. Patient \nreceived PO lansoprazole twice daily for two weeks. He had no \nmore episodes of GI bleeding through his stay and he was \ntransitioned to his home famotidine 20 mg daily. Hemoglobin was \nstable on discharge. \n\n# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus\nPatient was on insulin gtt in the ICU and transitioned to basal \ninsulin glargine 16u with Humalog insulin sliding scale.\n\n#SVT (resolved) \n#Likely MAT\nAppeared to have MAT on EKG while in MICU. Has intermittent \nepisodes of SVT into the 130s while on dialysis. Blood pressure \nhas been stable without any symptoms noted during episodes. Rate \ncontrol is being deferred given soft blood pressures and issues \nwith hypotension during HD. \n\nCHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES\n=======================\n#Nutrition: Began home tube feeds which was advanced\n\n#Transaminase elevation: He had a mild transaminase elevation \nlast admission in ___ thought to be ___ drug effect from \nantibiotics.\" Known to be HCV positive but not active given \nnegative surface antigen. No thrombosis or sign of chronic liver \ndisease on RUQUS. No hx of new drugs that would likely cause \nDILI. Intermittently hypotensive and likely ischemic \nhepatopathy. Resolved.\n\n# PVD: Held atorvastatin initially due to liver injury, \nrestarted atorvastatin after liver function normalized per \nneurology recommendations given vascular disease. Held \ngabapentin throughout his hospital stay due to mental status.\n\n#Gout: Continued allopurinol which was changed to every other \nday dosing on ESRD.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n[] Can likely stop keppra in ___ mo pending Neurology would like \nto see him as an outpatient and they will place EEG and wean him \noff his keppra.

Per records, \nthe patient was first admitted at ___ from ___ with \nhypertensive emergency and multiple falls at home. He was \ndiagnosed with influenza and was given Tamiflu. His hospital \ncourse was complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid \nventricular response, delirium with somnolence after \nbenzodiazepine administration, and acute kidney injury. During \nthe hospital course he had a leukocytosis to 17 for which blood \ncultures were drawn. He was found to have MSSA bacteremia and \nwas placed on cefazolin for a planned four week course from \n___. TTE showed mild-moderate MR without obvious \nvegetation. Given concern for osteo, MRI pelvis was attempted \ntwice but the patient was not able to tolerate the study.

He was \nfound to have right-sided acute and subacute rib fractures \n(___). He was given a TLSO brace for comfort. Pain control was \nattempted with an epidural, but was only marginally effective. \nUltimately, he was discharged back to rehab with oxycontin, \noxycodone, Tylenol, and a fentanyl patch. Of note, patient was \nfound to be occasionally somnolent, and attempts were made to \nreduce his regimen. He was also found to have chest imaging \nfindings concerning for pneumonia. However, given his clinical \npicture was felt more likely to be aspiration in the setting of \nsomnolence. He was continued on cefazolin throughout this \nhospitalization for his MSSA bacteremia, as noted above. \n\nPatient was discharged back to rehab on ___. He completed his \nantibiotics course on ___ as planned. However, since ___ was \nnoted by staff to be altered. No known fevers at rehab. His labs \nwere drawn and notable for a leukocytosis to 17.7.

No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.\n2. Focal hypodensity within the left basal ganglia, likely \ncompatible with\nprior lacunar infarct.\n3. Moderate mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus \nsuggests ongoing\ninflammation.\n \n___ CT ABD/PELVIS:\n1.  Compared with the outside hospital chest CT from ___,\nprogression of the T12 vertebral body compression deformity, now \nwith\nincreased lucency, cortical destruction, paravertebral soft \ntissue, and\nenlarged lucency within the inferior T11 vertebral body.  \nFindings are\nconcerning for infection resulting in osteomyelitis and \ndiscitis, given the\nrapid progression.  Further assessment with MRI is recommended.\n2.  Heterogeneous hyperdense asymmetric enlargement of the left \npsoas muscle at the level of the inferior left kidney, \ncompatible with a hematoma in the setting of known \nanticoagulation.\n3.  New moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent right lung \nbase\nconsolidation and atelectasis.  Superimposed infection is \nconsidered in the\nappropriate clinical setting.  Small left pleural effusion is \nrelatively\nunchanged.\n\n___ MRI SPINE: \n1. The study is degraded by motion artifact.\n2. Pathological fracture of the T12 vertebral body with relative \npreservation of the anterior and posterior vertebral body \nheights.  The central aspect of the vertebral body does not \nenhance in keeping with a pathological fracture most likely \nsecondary to infection.  There is enhancement of the adjacent \nparavertebral soft tissue and there is involvement of the \ninferior aspect of the T11 vertebral body.  These findings are \nmost consistent with a pathological fracture secondary \nto/destruction of the T12 vertebral body by osteomyelitis.\n3.  There is and associated mixed intensity collection the left \npsoas muscle most likely representing a psoas abscess.  The \nsignal intensity of the collection is slightly atypical for an \nabscess being T2 mixed Iso and hyperintense with a surrounding \nT2 hypointense rim and a psoas hematoma secondary to a \npathological fracture should be considered in the differential \ndiagnosis.\n4. Moderate severe spinal canal stenosis at the L3-___s moderate severe left L3-4 neural foraminal narrowing \ndescribed above.\n5. No compromise of the thoracic cord in the thoracic spinal \ncanal.\n6. Small epidural collection at T11-12.\n\nECHO: Suboptimal image quality. \n1) Image quality poor with this limitation in mind no \nechocardiographic evidence of endocarditis seen.\n2) Moderate pulmonary systolic arterial hypertension in setting \nof mild RV dilation and normal RV systolic longitudinal \nfunction. There is moderate tricuspid regurgitation and severe \nRA dilaton. LV e' velocities are high arguing against primary LV \npathology as cause of pulmonary hypertension. \n-The patient has a mildly dilated ascending aorta. Based on ___ \nACCF/AHA Thoracic Aortic Guidelines, if not previously known or \na change, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in ___ year; if \npreviously known and stable, a follow-up echocardiogram is \nsuggested in ___ years. \n\n___ MRI LEFT SHOULDER\n1. No findings specific for septic arthritis of the glenohumeral \njoint.  Trace to small glenohumeral joint effusion, could be \nrelated to rotator cuff pathology and biceps tendon tear, \nsuperimposed infection cannot be excluded.  If clinical concern \nfor septic arthritis, joint fluid sampling could be obtained.\n2. Moderate to high-grade articular surface tearing of the \nsupraspinatus\ntendon with additional full-thickness tear along the leading \nedge.\n3. Moderate tendinosis and interstitial tearing of the \ninfraspinatus tendon\nwith probable calcific tendinitis near its insertion. Recommend \ncorrelation with left shoulder radiographs.\n4. Likely complete tear of the intra-articular portion of the \nbiceps tendon\nwith retraction.\n5. Small amount of subacromial subdeltoid bursal fluid.\n6. Moderate degenerative type changes of the acromioclavicular \njoint.  No\nfindings specific for septic arthritis.\n7. Diffuse red marrow changes.\n\n___ SHOULDER XRAY: Degenerative changes.  No acute fracture \nis seen.  Some narrowing of the acromial humeral interval raises \npossibility of rotator cuff tear.\n\n___ CXR: Right PICC line tip most likely terminates in the \nproximal right atrium and should be pulled back 4 cm.  Patient \nis in pulmonary edema.  Right pleural effusion is moderate.  \nLeft pleural effusion is small.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly.\n\n___: MRI T/L-SPINE\n1. Discitis and osteomyelitis are again demonstrated T11-T12.  \nSevere collapse of T12 vertebral body and minimal T11 vertebral \nbody loss of height are unchanged.  Contrast enhancement in the \nposterior aspect of the T11-T12 disc has increased.  Small right \nanterior epidural phlegmon has slightly increased, displacing \nthe spinal cord without compression. \n2. Unchanged T12-L1 disc edema without enhancement, a \nnonspecific finding \nwhich may be reactive.  New mild edema and contrast enhancement \nin the \nsuperior endplate of L1 may be reactive, though spread of \ninfection cannot be excluded definitively. \n3. Persistent edema and contrast enhancement of the left psoas \nfrom T12 \nthrough S1, with stable peripherally enhancing fluid pockets \nbetween L3 and L5 which may in part be related to hematomas.  \nHowever, superimposed infection and abscess formation cannot be \nexcluded. \n4. Stable mild bilateral posterior paravertebral edema from L2 \nthrough L5. \n5. Multilevel degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, with \nmoderate to \nsevere spinal canal stenosis at L3-L4, are again demonstrated. \n6. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are \nagain partially visualized. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old male with PMH Of DM w/ \nneuropathy, A fib on warfarin, COPD, Charcot foot, gout, kidney \ninjury, CHF, alcohol use disorder, w/ recent admission for MSSA \nbacteremia, readmission for rib fractures, who now presents as a \ntransfer from rehab facility for elevated WBC and new mental \nstatus changes, found to have vertebral osteomyelitis.\n\n# Osteomyelitis \n# Fever, Leukocytosis\n# Sepsis \nPatient presented with new leukocytosis and fever having just \ncompleted a 4 week course of cefazolin on ___ for MSSA \nbacteremia.

She presents to the ED after repeat \nTTE reveals increasing effusion with signs of frank tamponade.\n\nIn regards to her recent hospitalization, she was admitted \n___ for scheduled TAVR. Briefly, her course was c/b CHB \nrequiring temp wire s/p TAVR. Shortly after placement she went \ninto PEA arrest for which she received 1 minute of CPR. This was \n___ dislodged pacer wire. EP then re-placed the temp wire. She \nwas also noted to have a pericardial effusion with tamponade \nphysiology (see below). A PPM was placed on ___. \nAdditionally, she was started on clopidogrel (already on \naspirin) for planned three month duration after which she would \nremain on lifelong ASA.\n\nIn regards to her pericardial effusion, patient was noted to \nhave small pericardial effusion on TTE (___) prior to TAVR \nwhich on repeat TTE on ___ was noted to be increased in size \n(moderate circumferential) without frank tamponade. She \ncompleted pericardiocentesis on ___ with removal of 170 cc of \nfluid that was negative for malignant cells (c/w reactive \ncells). Surveillance TTE on ___ showed rapid re-accumulation of \npericardial fluid, which was described as small to moderate with \necho evidence for increased pericardial pressure and tamponade \nphysiology. While awaiting cytology results she was monitored \nhemodynamically with frequent pulsus paradoxus check and \nsurveillance TTEs.

You also had a urinary tract infection \nrequiring a course of intravenous (or IV, through your vein) \nantibiotics. In addition, your LDH was high concerning for a \nclot in your LVAD and you received anticoagulation with a \nbivalirudin drip to treat the clot. Your level of \nanticoagulation on warfarin subsequently increased to an \nappropriate level, so your bivalirudin was stopped.\n\nMoving forward: \n-You should continue to take the medications below as written. \n-If you notice any changes in the readings on your LVAD device, \nyou should contact your cardiologist immediately.  \n-Please reference the additional handout provided by your \nurologist with instructions and information about your surgery \nand post-operative plan of care.\n-You will continue taking antibiotics for your urinary tract \ninfection through ___.\n-You were restarted on your floirinef 3 times a week.\n-Resume your pre-admission medications except as noted AND note \nthat you NO longer need to take medications that shrink your \nprostate (Hytrin, Avodart, Flomax, etc.)\n-You may take Tylenol for pain control. The maximum dose of \nTylenol (ACETAMINOPHEN) is 4 grams (from ALL sources) PER DAY.\n-For your safety and the safety of others; PLEASE DO NOT drive, \noperate dangerous machinery, or consume alcohol while taking \nnarcotic pain medications. \n-No heavy lifting for 4 weeks (no more than 10 pounds). Light \nhousehold chores are generally \u0093ok\u0094.  Fold laundry but ___ \nlift it. Wash/Dry dishes. Do not Vacuum. \n-resume regular home diet and remember to drink plenty of fluids \nto keep hydrated and to minimize risk of constipation. \n-___ medical attention for fevers (temp>101.5), worsening pain, \ndrainage or excessive bleeding from incision, chest pain or \nshortness of breath.\n\nThank you for letting us be a part of your care!\nYour ___ Team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n\n",

There is mild-moderate left ventricular \nregional systolic dysfunction with XXX (see schematic) and \nmoderate global hypokinesis of the remaining segments. No \nthrombus or mass is seen in the\nleft ventricle. Quantitative 3D volumetric left ventricular \nejection fraction is 35 % (normal 54-73%). Due to severity of \nmitral regurgitation, intrinsic left ventricular systolic \nfunction is likely lower. Left ventricular cardiac index is \nnormal (>2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular \noutflow tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size \nwith moderate global free wall hypokinesis. Tricuspid annular \nplane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is depressed. The aortic sinus \ndiameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta \ndiameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a \nnormal descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) \nare mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There \nis no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear \nstructurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is \nmoderate mitral annular calcification. There is moderate to \nsevere [3+] mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the \nseverity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The \npulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. The tricuspid valve \nleaflets appear structurally normal. There is mild to moderate \n[___] tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \nregional and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction most \nconsistent with coronary artery disease or other diffuse \nprocess. Moderate to severe mitral regurtitation. Moderate \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Right\nventricular free wall hypokinesis. Compared with the prior TTE \n(images not available for review) of ___, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure is now increased. \n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient's LVEF is less than 40%; a \nthreshold for which they may benefit from a beta blocker and an \nACE inhibitor (or ___ and a mineralocorticoid receptor \nantagonist.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n====================\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: \n==================== \n___, ___, with h/o ESRD on ___ HD, type II \ndiabetes, asthma, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, coronary \nartery disease, HFrEF EF 35%, atrial fibrillation on warfarin \nwho presents with generalized weakness, fevers and epistaxis \nfound to have supratherapeutic INR, hyperkalemia and \ncommunity-acquired pneumonia.

By \ndischarge, had received consistent ___ HD which he was \ntolerating well.\n\n# Supratherapeutic INR\n# Acute on chronic extensive RUE DVT\nPresented with INR > 13.8. Reversed. Once INR dropped, patient \ndeveloped RUE DVT, with ultrasound showing extensive DVT \ninvolving the right subclavian, axillary, and one of the paired \nbrachial veins. Per initial Hematology recommendation, bridged \nwith heparin then transitioned back to warfarin, goal INR ___. \nIt was difficult to achieve a stable INR during his hospital \ncourse and after discussion with renal team, transitioned him to \napixaban 5mg BID. He was discharged with 1 month supply.\n\n# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy\n# Transient aphasia\n# Multifocal intracranial stenosis\nPatient had apparent transient expressive aphasia on ___ in the \nsetting of receiving dialysis. However this was difficult to \nassess given concominant delirium, metabolic derangements and \nrequirement for ___ language interpreter. Neurology was \nconsulted and Code Stroke was called with reassuring workup. CT \nhead, MRI/MRA brain, and CTA head/neck which did not show acute \nstroke, but did demonstrate severe intracranial atherosclerotic \ndisease. Home atorvastatin was increased to 80mg. Continued on \nhome aspirin 81mg.\n\n# Diabetic retinopathy\nNeuro team noted monocular diplopia. He was followed up by \nophthalmology on ___ who noted moderate bilateral cataracts and \nmoderate-severe diabetic retinopathy. Recommended follow up in \nophthalmology clinic.\n\n# Rehab needs:\nSeverely reconditioned.  Pt originally refused transition to \nrehab preferring to return home with family.

Did not restart while \ninpatient due to hypotension after HD, would resume if able as \nan outpatient. Anticoagulation per above.\n\n# Dyspnea/Chest tightness\nPatient complained intermittently of dyspnea which was thought \nmultifactorial from fluid overload, deconditioning, and asthma. \nEKGs were not concerning for active ischemia. He was treated for \nasthma as below.\n\n# Constipation\nStarted on bowel regimen which was uptitrated to miralax BID and \n2 tabs of senna BID, then started having loose stools. \nDischarged with daily miralax. Please monitor.\n\n# Elevated Lactate\n# Respiratory alkalosis\nHad an episode of respiratory distress iso fluid overload with \nrespiratory alkalosis and lactate of 8 which decreased without \nintervention, thought possibly related to poor renal clearance \nvs. type D from frequent\nnebulizer treatments.\n\n# Leukocytosis\nIntermittently elevated to 10 range, thought iso infection and \ninflammation.\n\n# Asthma\nContinued albuterol prn and fluticasone BID.

Severe cardiomegaly is chronic, \nprobably \nworsened.   \n\nTransvenous right ventricular pacer lead in standard placement.  \nNo \npneumothorax.   \n\nNew right PIC line ends in the right brachiocephalic vein just \nbefore the \norigin of the SVC, approximately 8.5 cm below the estimated \nlocation of the superior cavoatrial junction. \n\n___ TEE\n\nPRE-BYPASS\n\nThe patient is in sinus tachycardia and receiving milrinone 0.25 \nmcg/kg/min, vasopressin 2.4 units/hr, epinephrine 0.03 \nmcg/kg/min, and norepinephrine 0.025 mcg/kg/min.\n\nThe left atrium is markedly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in \nthe left atrium or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is \nmoderately dilated, pacing wires are seen in the RA and RV. No \natrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, \ncolor Doppler or saline contrast with Valsalva maneuvers. The \nleft ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left \nventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= ___ \n%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The \nright ventricular cavity is dilated there is mild hypokinesis of \nthe RV free wall worsening towards the apex. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \nexcursion. There is no aortic stenosis. There is trivial aortic \nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally \nnormal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild \nTR. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nPOST-BYPASS \n\nThe patient is in sinus tachycardia and receiving milrinone \n0.375 mcg/kg/min, vasopressin 2.4 units/hr, epinephrine 0.08 \nmcg/kg/min, and norepinephrine 0.03 mcg/kg/min. Inhaled \nepoprostenol is being administered at 0.05 mcg/kg/min. LVAD \nspeed is adjusted after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass \nwith a final speed of 9000 rpm. \n\nLV dysfunction remains severe. A well-positioned LVAD inflow \ncannula is seen in the LV apex directed towards the MV opening, \nwith inflow velocities < 2.0 m/s. The LVAD outflow cannula is \nappropriately positioned in the ascending aorta with velocities \n< ___ m/s. At an LVAD speed of 9000 rpm the interventricular \nseptum was midline to rightward bowing with partial LV \ndecompression. The aortic valve remained mostly closed at this \nspeed, with occasional partial leaflet opening. \n\nAfter discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass, the right \nventricular dysfunction was mild on the noted inotropic support. \nWith chest closure, the outflow graft appeared to compress a \nportion of the RV free wall, creating moderate dysfunction; \nhowever there were no significant changes in hemodynamic \nmeasurements, SVO2, or CI. \n\nThe thoracic aorta remains intact.\n\n___ TTE\n\nThe coronary sinus is dilated (diameter >15mm). Left ventricular \nwall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe \nglobal left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF <20 %). The right \nventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global free \nwall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The \naortic valve does not open. The mitral valve appears \nstructurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate \n[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial \neffusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nbiventricular systolic function is now more depressed, a \nHeartmate is now seen, and the aortic valve no longer opens\n\n___ CTA CORONARY ARTERY WITH 3D W/F\n\nADDENDUM  In addition to the previously reported findings and \nimpression:\nAn anterior mediastinal hematoma and potential pericardial \neffusion may also\ncontribute to compression of the anterior wall of the right \nventricle,\nsubstantial reduction in right ventricular volume, and \nflattening of the\ninterventricular septum compared to the pre-operative exam in \n___.  The\ndegree of mediastinal hematoma and pericardial effusion is \ndifficult to\ndistinguish on the current exam.\n \nRecommend repeating an echocardiogram to further evaluate, and \nconsider\nrepeating cardiac CTA depending on the patient's current \nclinical status.\n \nCorrection to the original report:  Smooth, circumferential \nfilling defect in\nthe inflow and outflow LVAD cannula is not partial thrombus but \nrather the\nexpected CT appearance of the cannula wall.\n\n___ LOWER EXT US \n\nNo evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower \nextremity\nveins.\n\n___ UPPER EXT US \n\nNonocclusive thrombus surrounding the pacemaker lead in the mid \nto distal left\nsubclavian vein.\n \nNo evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper extremity \nveins.\n\n___ CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST\n \nThere is a hyperdense collection measuring 77 x 56 mm in the \naxial plane and\n81 Hounsfield units seen in the left lateral chest wall in \nrelation to the\nserratus anterior muscle with associated air locules and \nsurrounding\nsubcentimeter lymph nodes suggestive of superimposed infection \n(on previous\nstudy done ___ there was a hematoma is seen in the \nleft serratus\nanterior muscle).  This process is remote from the LVAD.\n \nMetallic streak artifact obscures the soft tissue/ pump pocket \nsurrounding the\nLVAD, but there is no obvious ___ LVAD collection or \nextravasation of\ncontrast.\n \nThere is interval improvement in the anterior mediastinal \nhematoma and\nhemorrhagic left pleural effusion.\n \nA few air locules seen in the right atrium which is thought to \nbe secondary to\nair injection and not suggestive of mediastinitis.  However if \nthe clinical\nsuspicion for mediastinitis is high then a non contrasted CT may \nbe performed\nto exclude mediastinal air locules/mediastinitis with absolute \ncertainty.\n \nThe median position of the LVAD outflow tract is again noted \nwith mass effect\non the right ventricle, but there is less right atrial \ndistention and reflux\nof contrast into the hepatic veins compared to immediate \nprevious study done\n___.\n\n___ ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND\n\nNo focal collection identified in the area of tenderness as \nindicated by the\npatient.\n\n \n___ LEFT SHOULDER X RAY \n\nNormal left shoulder radiographs.\n\n___ CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST\n\nSingle air bubble likely within upper margin of the right \natrium; previously\nseen additional air bubbles have resolved.\n\n___ ECHOCARDIOGRAM \n\nThe right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right \nventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall \nhypokinesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+] \ntricuspid regurgitation is seen. [In the setting of at least \nmoderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to \na very high right atrial pressure.] \n\nIntermittent aortic valve opening is seen at 9200 RPM. At all \nhigher pump speeds, little or no aortic valve opening is seen. \nThe interventricular septum is in a leftward displaced \nconfiguration at all speeds higher than 9200 RPM (neutral at \n9000 and 9200 RPM), with severe tricuspid regurgitation and \nright ventricular dilation at all speeds. \n\n___ CT HEAD (episode of unresponsiveness)\n \nThere is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass.  \nThe\nventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration.\n \nThere is no evidence of fracture.  A mucous retention cyst is \nseen in the\nright maxillary sinus.  Remaining visualized paranasal sinuses, \nmastoid air\ncells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  The globes are \nunremarkable.\n \nIMPRESSION:\n\n1.

He\nrequired milrinone therapy and diuresis for optimization.  He \nwas\nnot a candidate for a heart transplant due to his\nmorbid obesity.  I was asked to evaluate him for\nconsideration of LVAD destination therapy.  The risks and\nbenefits of the operation were discussed with the patient, he\nconsented to proceed.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After the patient was placed under\nanesthesia and intubated, his chest, abdomen, and lower\nextremities were prepped with chlorhexidine and draped in the\nusual fashion.  The intraoperative transesophageal\nechocardiogram showed that his left ventricular function had\nan ejection fraction of 10% to 20%.  He had a dilated right\nventricular cavity with mild global right ventricular free\nwall hypokinesis.  He had mild mitral regurgitation and trace\naortic regurgitation.  There was no PFO.\n\nA median sternotomy was made.  The incision was extended a\ncouple centimeters below the xiphoid process.  The\npreperitoneal pocket was created and the pericardium was\nopened up.  The patient was fully heparinized prior to\ninserting the aortic cannula and a venous cannula into the\nright atrial appendage.  We went on bypass.  I elevated the\nleft ventricular apex and identified the dimpled portion.  I\ncored out the LV apex and anchored the apical sewing ring with\npledgeted ___ Ethibond sutures.  BioGlue was then sprayed around\nthe raw surface and around the suture line.  The pump was then\nattached to the apical sewing ring and tied down with a heavy\nsuture and fastened with a silastic strap for reinforcement.  \nThe\noutflow graft was then connected up to the pump.  A side-biting\nclamp was placed on the proximal ascending aorta and the graft\nwas measured and cut appropriately at a beveled angle.\nLongitudinal aortotomy was made and the outflow graft was\nthen sewn to the aorta with running ___ Prolene sutures.  A\nde-airing needle was placed into the graft.  The drive line,\nwhich had been brought out through the left side of the \nabdominal wall, was then connected up to the controller.  We\nstarted at 6000 rpm.  The patient was ventilated.  The\nside-biting clamp was released.  As we came down on the\ncardiopulmonary bypass machine, we went up on the rpm of the\npump.  There was minimal air seen on the echocardiogram. The\napical ring was in good position. With the assistance from \nthe echocardiogram, we adjusted the rpm until the left\nventricular cavity was adequately decompressed.  The\nintraventricular septum was midline.  The right ventricular\ndysfunction was mild with some inotropic support.  Protamine\nwas given to reverse heparin.  The cannulas were removed.\nThree chest tubes were inserted, one in the left apical/left\npleural space and two in the anterior mediastinum.  A piece of\nGortex tube graft was used to cover the outflow graft. The\npericardium was reapproximated around the aorta and the right\nventricle and the remaining opening was covered with\nCorMatrix.  The sternum was closed with stainless steel\nwires.  The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous tissues were\nclosed in 2 layers with running Vicryl sutures.  The skin was\nclosed with running subcuticular Monocryl sutures.  Prevena\nwas placed over the incision.  The patient left the\noperating room, intubated and in stable condition, on\ninotropes and pressors.\n\n___ LEFT CHEST TUBE INSERTION\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:  None.\n\nINDICATIONS:  This is a ___ male who underwent\nplacement of an LVAD on ___.  Postoperatively, he\ndeveloped a large left pleural effusion.  I recommended\ndraining his effusion and discussed the risks and benefits of\na chest tube insertion with the patient.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Patient was placed in a slight\nright lateral decubitus position.  His left chest was prepped\nwith chlorhexidine and draped in the usual fashion.  1%\nlidocaine was used to infiltrate the subcutaneous tissues, as\nwell as the intercostal area.  An incision was made.\nDissection was carried down into the chest wall.  I entered\nthe interspace and inserted a ___ angled chest tube,\nangled posteriorly.  The fluid that we got back was\nserosanguineous in nature.  A total of 1090 cc of fluid was\ndrained.  The chest tube was anchored down with silk sutures\nand a dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the\nprocedure.\n\n==========================\nMICRO\n==========================\n\n___ blood cultures:  No growth.\n\n___ and ___ CATH TIP: NO GROWTH \n\n___ - ___, multiple sets of blood cultures all \nnegative/NGTD. \n\n___ and ___ STOOL: Negative for toxigenic C. difficile \nby the Illumigene DNA amplification assay.

This was likely something called ischemic colitis, \nwhich occurs when there is low blood pressure to the intestines. \nIt may also be infectious. A biopsy was taken to confirm these \nresults.\n\nFor ischemic colitis, it is important that your blood pressure \nremain stable and not go too low. Because of that, we held your \nlosartan and spironolactone. You will also complete a 5 day \ncourse of antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole).\n\nYou were stable and discharged home after the procedure.\n\nIt was a privilege to care for you in the hospital, and we wish \nyou all the best.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour ___ Health Team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n\n",

Foley was placed and he \nauto-diuresed to dry weight with resolution of hypoxemia. \n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n==========================================\n# Hypoxemia\n# Interstitial lung disease\n# Pulmonary edema\nPatient presented with two days of cough and shortness of breath \nwith preceding fatigue of about 10 days. He was found to have \nhypoxemia to\nmid-80s and admitted for further work-up. CT chest w/o contrast \nshowed asymmetric but bilateral reticulation and ground glass \nopacities as well as bronchiectasis and dilation of airways most \nsevere in RUL, with LUL relatively spared. These findings were \nfelt to be consistent with ILD with both an active inflammatory \nand chronic component. Initial TTE revealed EF 50%, severe pHTN \n(PASP 71), and RV hypertrophy, concerning for chronic pulmonary \nhypertension process. Pulmonary was consulted and recommended \nbroad work-up for ILD which was negative including: ___, ANCA, \ndsDNA, RF, anti-GBM, ___, anti-RNP, anti-Ro, anti-La, \nScl70, anti-CCP, HIV, aldolase, myositis panel, and respiratory \nviral panel. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel was pending at \ntime of discharge. The patient initially required ___ NC for \nsupplemental O2, which was subsequently able to be weaned off \nwith diuresis (see below). After the patient was felt to have \ndiuresed to his dry weight, repeat CXR and TTE were obtained \nwhich showed improvement in pulmonary HTN and lung opacities. \n\n# Hypertensive emergency\nOn presentation the patient was noted to have elevated blood \npressures to 200s/100s. Although he was asymptomatic, he was \nnoted to have significant O2 requirement felt to be secondary to \npulmonary edema. He was started on nitroglycerin gtt titrated to \nSBP 140s-160s, then weaned to labetalol and hydralazine. \nEventually he was transitioned to a regimen of labetalol and \namlodipine which good BP control. His home atenolol was held in \nthe setting ___ (see below). His blood pressures remained \nstable. \n\n# Acute kidney injury, post-renal\nBaseline creatinine 1.2 in ___. On admission the patient was \nfound to have Cr 2.4 which subsequently rose to 3.0. Renal \nultrasound showed moderate bilateral hydroureteral nephrosis \nconsistent with obstruction. Notably the patient has a history \nof prostate cancer and a very enlarged prostate. He did have \ntraumatic foley placement and eventually required cystoscopic \nplacement of foley by Urology. Afterwards he was noted to have \nsignificant urine output of ___ daily and subsequent \nimprovement in his creatinine. Per Urology, foley remained in \nplace at discharge with plan for Urology follow-up. He was \ncontinued on doxazosin 4mg QHS and finasteride 5mg QD which he \nhad recently stopped. \n\n# Normocytic anemia\nBaseline Hb 13.3. The patient presented with Hb at 10.6. Other \nthan intermittent hematuria he had no evidence of bleeding. Iron \nstudies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease with low \nreticulocyte count indicating inflammatory block. His hemoglobin \nremained stable throughout admission. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n==========================================\n# Radiation proctitis\n# Incontinence\nAs above, foley was placed during this admission with Urology \nand the patient was discharged with foley in place given \ntraumatic placement and very large prostate.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n==========================================\n[] Discharged with Foley, plan to follow-up with Urology for \nremoval\n[] Patient was found to have new ILD of unclear etiology and \npulmonary hypertension during this admission.

Alternatively, fever \nmay be secondary to infectious process but in the absence of\nfocal infectious symptoms unlikely. In light of her infectious \nrisk however, we sent blood culture, urine culture, urinalysis \n(all negative). As there was potential exposure to \nparainfluenza, we obtained a rapid influenza panel (negative) \nand rapid viral panel (pending). Deferred empiric antibiotics \nfor now as she is not neutropenic and does not have focal \nsymptoms. CXR did not reveal pneumonia. Also, there was some \nthought that her fever may be secondary to Bactrim as \neosinophils were uptrending since restarting Bactrim though she \nremains without rash.

She received monthly Rituxan thereafter. \nShe presented on ___ with new c/o breast lumps. Breast Bx ___ \nshowed high grade lymphoma. Thereafter, she had a PET CT that \nshowed an FDG avid cervical node as well as FDG uptake in the \nright distal tibia. Given these findings, trial w/ immunotherapy\nagent with bispecific antibody was offered to patient. Work up \nfor BITE included a BMBX which was negative for lymphoma \ninvolvement. Brain MRI was unremarkable for disease, and MRI \nankle to further assess if that is a site of disease. She is s/p\nweek 3 of protocol ___ with bi-specific antibody therapy, now \nadmitted for week 4. Notably, during week three, she has \npalpable lymph nodes (tonsillar, cervical and breast) that \ndeveloped after BITE was administered but slowly becoming \nsmaller (? likely from pseudo-progression). She continues on \nprophylaxis w/ Acyclovir BID\nDuring admission re-trialed Bactrim for PCP ppx, which she \ntolerated without rash.

Patient was also found to be severely hypothyroid and \nhad a urinary tract infection on presentation. Etiology of \nhyponatremia likely due to combination of extrarenal losses from \ndiarrhea, SIADH, and hypothyroidism. Blood sodium level was \nslowly increased with IV NS boluses as well as changing tubefeed \nregimen. Salt tabs were also started with resolution of \nhyponatremia. Patient was found to be severely hypothyroid and \nlevothyroxine was started with plan to continue titrating up \nlevothyroxine dose following discharge. Urine culture in the \nemergency department grew pseudomonas which was sensitive to \nciprofloxacin and patient completed 3 day course. Patient was \ndischarged on salt tabs and modified tubefeed regimen as well as \n50 mcg daily levothyroxine.\n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n===============\n# Hyponatremia:\n# Diarrhea:\n# SIADH:\nNa incidentally found to be 123. Uosm >100, UNa<20 on admission, \nconsistent with hypovolemia, likely due to diarrhea at home \n(unknown etiology) contributing to extrarenal losses. Patient \ndid have antibiotic treatment after arriving at the hospital but \nsuspicion for C. diff was low as diarrhea started prior to \nadmission. Hypothyroidism possibly contributing as well (see \nbelow). Noted that duloxetine can cause hyponatremia in the \nelderly, but the time course of hyponatremia did not fit this as \nbeing a cause. Patient was initially given IV NS with \nappropriately slow response of ~6 mEq/24 hours increase in serum \nNa. Patient was also determined to have a component of SIADH \nwith urine Na>40 and urine osm>100 on later urine electrolyte \ncheck. Tubefeeds were adjusted to have higher solute content and \nminimize free water intake. Salt tabs were started with good \nresponse. Patient was discharged on salt tabs and new tubefeed \nregimen per nutrition and sodium level on discharge was 135. The \npatient was provided with a script for a lab draw on discharge \nand the need for monitoring was communicated with her outpatient \nprovider.\n\n# Hypothyroidism\nTSH was checked as part of euvolemic hyponatremia workup. Found \nto be 96 with FT4 1.4. Endocrine was consulted and recommended \nstarting levothyroxine at 50 mcg with long term plan to titrate \nup dose. Cosyntropin stim test was performed to rule out adrenal \ninsufficiency; result was normal. Additionally, tubefeeds were \nchanged to 20 hours a day as levothyroxine absorption is \ndisrupted by continuous tubefeeds. TSH and FT4 were rechecked on \ndischarge but were pending at discharge. See transitional issues \nfor long-term plan regaring levothyroxine.\n\n# Urinary tract infection\nPatient with positive urinalysis on admission w/ nitrites and \n___, WBC in urine and mild leukocytosis. Patient was treated with \n3 days of ceftriaxone while urine culture pended. Urine culture \nfrom ED grew pseudomonas aeruginosa, so patient also received 3 \nday course of ciprofloxacin.\n\n# Nutrition\nPatient's tubefeed regimens were switched around several times \nthis admission as the team pursued tubefeed regimen initially \nthat would limit free water and maximize solute, and then had to \nreadjust again to make 4 hour gap in the day to administer \nlevothyroxine. Patient was discharged on new tubefeed regimen \nper nutrition. Additionally, patient received zinc and ascorbic \nacid repletion to continue on discharge for 11 and 3 additional \ndays, respectively\n\n# Skin breakdown\nPatient admitted with coccyx and partially on inner thighs. Per \nson, patient had much worse pressure ulcers upon discharge from \na nursing home she was briefly put in earlier this year. Wound \ncare was consulted and their recommendations were followed.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n# Non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes\nHome metformin and glipizide were held while in house and \npatient was on humalog sliding scale. Blood glucose levels were \nwell controlled with the exception of one day when patient was \non osmolite - resolved with switch back to glucerna tubefeeds.\n\n# UC\nContinued home mesalamine and ursodiol\n\n# Hx of CVA\nContinued home asa, statin. Continued home keppra, \nmethylphenidate\n\n# GERD: \nContinued home PPI\n\n# Constipation\nContinued home bowel reg\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n[ ] Several changes were made this admission that could affect \npatient's sodium levels including new tubefeed regimen, starting \nsalt tabs, and treating her hypothyroidism. She will need close \nmonitoring of her sodium level in the period following \ndischarge. The patient was provided with a script for a lab draw \non discharge. \n\n[ ] Note that patient has been on duloxetine, which is known to \ncause hyponatremia in the elderly. Though the time course of her \nhyponatremia does not necessarily suggest that this is a factor \nin her hyponatremia, this medication should be noted moving \nforward and one might consider whether this medication is \nactually providing any benefit to her.\n\n[ ] Patient was found to be severely hypothyroid this admission. \nThe endocrinologists have recommended the following scheduling \nof tracking thyroid function tests (TFT's) and adjusting \nlevothyroxine (Lt4) doses:\n-Recheck TFT's on ___ including TSH and free T4 (NOT T4 by \ndialysis). If T4/T3 labs show an increase and she continues to \ntolerate the medication, continue levothyroxine at 50mcg.\n- ___ Increase levothyroxine to 75mcg\n- ___ Recheck TSH and ___ If absorption is good and TSH begins to respond, then \nincrease levothyroxine to 100 mcg. Based on her initial weight, \ngoal levothyroxine (1.6x weight in kilos) would be around 122.5.\n\nMEDICATION CHANGES\nNew medications:\n[ ] Sodium chloride tabs 1 gm po/ng tid\n[ ] Levothyroxine sodium 50 mcg po/ng daily\n[ ] Zinc sulfate 220 mg po/ng daily for 11 additional days\n[ ] Ascorbic acid ___ mg po/ng bid for 3 additional days\n\nChanged medications:\nNone\n\nHeld medications:\nNone\n\nName of health care ___\nRelationship:son\nPhone ___\nCell ___\nCode: full presumed\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You were given \nIV fluids with sodium in them to increase your blood sodium \nlevel. Additionally, your tubefeeds were modified as your \nmedical team and nutritionists tried to determine the optimal \ntubefeeding regimen for you. You were also started on salt tabs \nto help keep your sodium level from falling.\n\n- You were found to have a very low level of thyroid hormone in \nyour body. The thyroid affects several functions in your body \nincluding metabolism and electrolyte balance. You were seen by \nour endocrinologists and started on a medication given through \nyour PEG tube to replenish thyroid hormone.\n\n- You were also incidentally found to have a urinary tract \ninfection, which was treated with a full course of the \nappropriate antibiotics.\n\n- You were continued on your home medications for your chronic \nillnesses as appropriate.\n\nWhat should I do when I leave the hospital?  \n- Be sure to take all of your medications exactly as prescribed.\n\n- You are being discharged on a modified tubefeeding regimen \nwhich will only be running for 20 hours in the day. This is \nbecause one of your new medications called levothyroxine, which \nis meant to treat your hypothyroidism, is not well absorbed when \ntubefeeds are running. Therefore, please take your levothyroxine \nexactly 2 hours after stopping tubefeeds each day.\n\n- Please limit water flushes to 100 mL with medications only. \n\n- Given the changes we have made during this hospital admission, \nyou will need your sodium level checked frequently in the period \nfollowing discharge.\n\n- Additionally, our endocrinologists have recommended a specific \nschedule of checking thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone \nlevels with appropriate dose adjustments in your thyroid \nmedication for the next few weeks. A copy of these instructions \nwill be forwarded to your home nurses.\n\n- Be sure to attend all of your follow up appointments as \nscheduled.\n\nSincerely,  \nYour ___ Care Team  \n\nMEDICATION CHANGES\nNew medications:\n[ ] Sodium chloride tabs 1 gm po/ng tid\n[ ] Levothyroxine sodium 50 mcg po/ng daily\n[ ] Zinc sulfate 220 mg po/ng daily for 11 additional days\n[ ] Ascorbic acid ___ mg po/ng bid for 3 additional days\n\nChanged medications:\nNone\n\nHeld medications:\nNone\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n\n \nName:  ___                   Unit No:   ___\n \nAdmission Date:  ___              Discharge Date:   ___\n \nDate of Birth:  ___             Sex:   M\n \nService: MEDICINE\n \nAllergies: \nBactrim / ibuprofen / morphine / NSAIDS (Non-Steroidal \nAnti-Inflammatory Drug)\n \nAttending: ___.\n \nChief Complaint:\nWorsening back pain, lower extremity pain \n \nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\n1.

Postoperative changes are seen in the lumbar ___ with \ninterbody graft at L3-4 level. There is anterior epidural soft \ntissue prominence seen at L3-4 low which could be secondary to \nrecurrent disc herniation or changes of discitis. No definite \nabscess is identified. The evaluation of the areas limited due \nto surrounding metallic artifacts. Correlation with prior \nimaging would be helpful and if none is available, further \nevaluation can be obtained with gallium scan to exclude spinal \ninfection in the setting of metallic hardware. 2. Posterior \nenhancing soft tissues in the lumbar region could be due to \nsurgery and postoperative change with no evidence of fluid \ncollection to indicate abscess but infection of the soft tissue \nwound is difficult to evaluate or exclude on MRI appearances \nalone and clinical correlation is recommended. 3. No evidence of \nabscess, diskitis or osteomyelitis in the cervical or thoracic \nregion. No cord compression.\n\n+ LUMBAR SINGLE VIEW S/P HARDWARE REMOVAL ___\n\nImages demonstrate previous surgery lumbar ___, with interbody \ndevices at the presumed L3-4 and L4-5 levels. Anterior screw and \nwasher demonstrated at L5. Surgical instruments are demonstrated \nposterior to the mid to lower lumbar ___. For details of the \nprocedure please see the procedure report. \n\n+ TTE (___): The left atrial volume index is normal. Normal \nleft ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global \nsystolic function (3D LVEF = 62%). Tissue Doppler imaging \nsuggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure \n(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good \nleaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \nregurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic \nvalve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial \nmitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the \nmitral valve. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure \nis normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. \n\nCT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS (___): \n1. Status post removal of lower lumbar fusion hardware as \ndescribed above. \n2. Residual interbody graft at L3-4, with ventral epidural \nabnormality at this level causing probably moderate central \ncanal narrowing, stable,, may reflect residual disc herniation \nversus phlegmon.  Given mild enhancement of the adjacent right \npsoas muscle, also present on prior, findings may favor \ninfection.  There is mild endplate irregularity of adjacent \nsuperior L4 endplate, indeterminate, this should be followed. \n3.

Found to have orthostatic hypotension likely \nfrom velcade toxicity and autonomic dysfunction from T2DM. After \nautonomic testing with neurology, was started on midodrine \nduring the day for orthostasis and captopril at night for supine \nhypertension, with improvement in symptoms prior to discharge.\n\n#L fibular fracture\nPatient presented to ___ following a fall from chair. He fell \nfrom his chair, without loss of consciousness, unwitnessed, \nhitting head and chin on the table while also suffering a \ntraumatic fracture to his distal fibula and posterior malleolus. \nOn ___ he had an open reduction internal trimalleolar fracture \npattern with out fixation of the posterior malleolus, \nexamination under anesthesia with manually applied rotational \nstress under fluoroscopy, fixation of the syndesmosis. \nPostoperatively recovered well, Lovenox (___) held and \nrestarted postoperatively. Had short cast placed on ___ with \nplan for follow-up with orthopedics in 4 weeks. \n\n# Dysautonomia \n# Postural hypotension\n# Supine hypertension and orthostatic hypotension - Patient with \nsignificant orthostatic hypotension that likely led to fall and \nfracture per above. During hospitalization consistently had SBP \nranging from 160-200s with significant orthostasis on standing \nwith SBP drops by 80mmHg on standing initially with symptoms \nincluding lightheadedness. Neurology autonomics was consulted \nand given temporal association of new orthostatic hypotension \nafter velcade treatment previously, strong clinical suspicion \nthat his postural hypotension was secondary to velcade with a \ncomponent of T2DM dysautonomia. He underwent autonomics testing \nwith neurology, was started on midodrine 2.5mg TID. Plan moving \nforward is for patient to receive midodrine 2.5mg at 8AM, 12PM \nand 4PM if patient is planning on standing. If he remains \nsupine, no need to give midodrine. To treat his supine \nhypertension, patient was prescribed captopril 2.5mg QHS at \n___. He did not symptomatically improve while trialing \nlabetalol during hospitalization, however did have improvement \nin his symptoms with midodrine and captopril. It is anticipated \npatient will continue to have SBP drops while standing however \nhis symptoms while assuming a standing position resolved prior \nto discharge. Of note patient was also previously on prednisone \n10mg daily due to prior concern for adrenal insufficiency, \nhowever has not been taking recently. Repeat cosyntropin \nstimulation test here showed no evidence of adrenal \ninsufficiency. \n\n#Headache \nDeveloped L temporal headache with lacrimation ___ \ninitially with concern for cluster headache. Without improvement \nwith oxygen therapy, resolved with Compazine. It is possible \nheadache is likely secondary to symptomatic supine HTN as \npatient noted resolution of HA with head elevation.

No significant \nmass effect or midline shift. Hyperdense appearance of lesion in \nthe right cerebral peduncle raises potential concern for \nintralesional hemorrhage. \n\nMRI Head w/ Contrast ___\n1. Hyperintensity of the left parietal scalp on diffusion \nimages, which may represent soft tissue edema from impact during \nfall. No evidence of traumatic hemorrhage. \n2. Interval improvement of at least 20 supra and infratentorial \nenhancing metastases, many of which have decreased in size, with \nsome smaller punctate lesions no longer well visualized. No \ndefinite new lesion. Extensive involvement of the posterior \nfossa could be responsible for ataxia. \n3. Largest lesion in the right parietal lobe demonstrates \nimproved surrounding vasogenic edema. \n4. Another prominent lesion in the right posterior frontal lobe \nhas decreased in size, though with mildly increased surrounding \nvasogenic edema. \n5. No other focus of hemorrhage, or infarct. \n\nRight Knee X-Ray ___\n1. Apparently vertically oriented lucency in the posterior \ntibial plateau, \npossibly artifactual nature. However in the setting of trauma, \nthis can represent a nondisplaced fracture. If there is history \nof trauma, CT is recommended for further evaluation. \n2. Severe medial compartment osteoarthritis. Small to moderate \nlateral and patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritis. \n3. Moderate joint effusion.\n\nCT Right Lower Extremity ___\nImpression: Acute nondisplaced posterior medial tibial plateau \nfracture. Moderate to severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis, \ngreatest medially. \n\nMRI C/T/L-Spine w/ Contrast ___\n1. Examination is moderately degraded by motion. \n2. 34 x 9 mm intra medullary enhancing lesion of the thoracic \ncord of the T8 level with extremity in surrounding edema \nspanning the spinal cord from T1 through to the conus \nmedullaris, suggesting intra medullary cord metastasis. \n3. 16 x 11 mm enhancing lesion in the right aspect of the T2 \nvertebral body concerning for osseous metastasis. \n4. Enlarging 33 x 21 mm soft tissue mass at the level of the \nright L2-L3 facet joint compatible with metastasis. \n5. Diffuse cervical, left supraclavicular, mediastinal, right \nhilar, retroperitoneal and left pelvic sidewall lymphadenopathy, \nwith many areas worsened compared to the prior examination. \n6. Small left-sided pleural effusion with subtle ill-defined \nareas of consolidation in the left lower lobe are not fully \ncharacterize, however may represent new areas of metastasis.  If \nclinically indicated, this can be further investigated with \ndedicated chest CT examination. \n7. 7 mm enhancing hepatic segment VII lesion, concerning for \nadditional focus of metastasis. \n8. Cervical, thoracic and lumbar spondylosis, as described. \n9. Postsurgical changes related to prior L4-5 left foraminotomy.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ man with metastatic renal cell \ncarcinoma, previously progressed on IL-2, pazopanib, axitinib, \nstarted on nivolumab (C1D1 = ___ but found to \nhave brain mets in ___ now s/p WBRT and on\nsteroids, presenting with ataxia and fall with worsening lower \nextremity weakness and found to have thoracic spine \nintramedullary metastases.\n\n# Ataxia/Spinal Cord Compression: Patient presented with \nworsening issues of coordination/balanace and falls at home, \nhead CT done in ED concern for possible hemorrhagic conversion \nof brain mets however MRI brain overall stable, possibly \nincreased edema. He had progressive lower extremity weakness and \nurinary retention requiring catheterization as well as numbness \nwhich prompted MRI spine showing intramedullary metastasis at T8 \nwith extensive vasogenic edema. His exam and imaging was \nconsistent with acute spinal cord compression secondary to \nintramedullary metastasis. He was placed on high dose steroids. \nRadiation Oncology consulted with plan for emergent radiation \ntherapy to T5-T9 which was completed ___. Neuro Oncology was \nconsulted who agreed with radiation therapy. Neurosurgery was \nconsulted who recommended no surgical intervention. ___ \nrecommended rehab. His steroids were decreased with planned \ntaper of ___ dexamethasone 1 mg PO daily then ___ \ndexamethasone 0.5 mg PO daily. Omeprazole was continued. Started \ngabapentin 300mg TID for neuropathic ___ numbness, and using \nprn oxycodone and valium for pain and spasms, though he required \nthese only very sparingly.\n\n# Hyponatremia: Stable in low 130s range. Initially urine lytes \nwith UNa of 72, but ultimately Na remained stable and despite \nfluids for hyperkalemia, so he may have developed a hypovolemic \ncomponent as well. Ultimately remained stable with 2L fluid \nrestriction which was continued as urine lytes continued to \nsuggest SIADH.\n\n# Hyperkalemia: Unclear etiology, but developed K to 5.___uring the hospitalization. After given gentle IVF this \nimproved. CK 17 (checked to eval for muscle breakdown from \nimmobility vs steroid myopathy).\n\n# Right Knee Fracture: CT imaging with acute nondisplaced right \nposterior medial tibial plateau fracture. Ortho consulted and \nrecommended closed treatment and no surgical intervention. No \nneed for arthrocentesis. No pain when not weight bearing. \nPatient remained nonambulatory due to cord compression. If he \nregains function, he can follow up with orthopedics. Continued \nprn oxycodone and Tylenol for pain though had no pain when not \nweight bearing.\n\n# Renal cell carcinoma, metastatic to the brain: He is now s/p \nWBRT and keppra for seizure prophylaxis. Last Nivolumab was \n___. Continued home keppra. Will f/u with his oncologist as \noutpatient.\n\n# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine.\n\n# Constipation: Continued senna, colace and miralax.\n\n====================\nTransitional Issues:\n====================\n- Patient on dexamethasone taper for spinal cord compression: \n1mg daily ___, then 0.5mg daily ___. Patient \nstarted on omeprazole for GI prophylaxis while on steroids and \ncan be discontinued after completion.\n- Patient started on diazepam, Tylenol, gabapentin, and \noxycodone for pain control.
