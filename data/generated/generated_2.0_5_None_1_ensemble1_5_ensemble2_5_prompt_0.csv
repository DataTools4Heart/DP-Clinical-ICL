Enclosed is a summary of the patient's clinical course and treatment during their recent hospital stay. The following conditions were identified:

The patient was admitted with symptoms suggestive of a severe inflammatory bowel disease flare, which required prompt medical attention. Upon evaluation, it was determined that the patient had developed severe ulceration in the [anatomical location], leading to significant pain, nausea, and vomiting.

In addition to the inflammatory bowel disease, the patient also presented with fatigue, weight loss, and arthralgias, indicative of a possible systemic illness. Further investigation revealed evidence of anemia (Hb < 10 g/dL) and leucopenia (WBC count 3,000 cells/μL), suggesting a hematological abnormality.

Notably, the patient also had a history of neuropathic pain in their [anatomical location], which was exacerbated by the inflammatory bowel disease. This condition required careful management to avoid further complications.

The patient underwent various treatments, including intravenous fluids, medications for inflammation and pain, and nutritional support to manage the anemia and weight loss. Additionally, a course of antibiotics was administered to address any potential infection.

During their hospital stay, the patient also developed a minor skin infection (erythema) on the [anatomical location], which responded well to topical treatment with antimicrobial agents.

Upon discharge, the patient was advised to continue taking oral medications for their inflammatory bowel disease, as well as supplementing their diet with essential nutrients. Follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor their condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

Please note that this summary is intended to provide a general overview of the patient's clinical course and should not be relied upon for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Any specific diagnoses or treatments should only be made in consultation with the healthcare provider who provided the care.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with past medical history 
significant for ITP, DM2, HTN who presents with coffee ground 
emesis and small BRBPR with outpatient labs notable for plts < 
5, prompting inpatient referral for concern for recurrent 
thrombocytopenia.

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============= 
# ITP: Patient was diagnosed with ITP about a month ago and is 
followed at ___ for her care. Her treatment course previously is 
as follows: oral dexamethasone 40 mg daily x 4 days (___), IV Ig 1 g/kg on ___ and ___, 
Prednisone 90 mg daily started on ___ tapered to 60 mg, 
Rituximab 375 mg/m2 4 doses recently completed, Promacta 50 mg 
daily started on ___ - ?___. Differential diagnosis in 
the past has included aplastic anemia vs thrombocytopenia 
predominant MDS, however these were felt less likely than ITP. 
___ was weakly positive at 1:40 last admission, anti-histone 
antibody was negative. HIV and HCV negative. HBV viral load 
negative but positive surface and core antibody, suggesting 
clearance of HBV. On last admit, heme thought the patient likely 
had steroid-refractory ITP, and likely rituximab was causing her 
platelets to go up during that admission. She was supposed to 
undergo a taper of her oral prednisone but this had not been 
started prior to her current hospitalization. Of note, the 
patient has been very frustrated with multiple hospital 
admissions in the past month. Bone marrow biopsy performed on 
___ had not returned by discharge but prelim review showed no 
overt leukemia, lymphoma or dysplasia. Heme onc followed her on 
this admission and she received higher dose prednisone 120 mg 
daily and NPlate 84 mcg on ___ platelets have since risen from 
<5 to 101 with this treatment. She will follow-up with Dr. 
___ in clinic on ___ for follow-up and steroid taper. She 
has been continued on Pantoprazole, Bactrim, and Vitamin D to 
avoid steroid-induced complications. Splenectomy was considered 
on this admission however given her improvement with medical 
management, this option has been deferred at this time. She 
received Hib, PCV13, and Trumenba prior to discharge and will 
need follow-up vaccines listed below in preparation for possible 
splenectomy. 

# T2DM: Prior to this hospitalization, she was on metformin, QHS 
lantus and standing mealtime and QHS humalog. With persistent 
hyperglycemia while on high-dose steroids, her insulin regimen 
was adjusted as follows and should be continued as below until 
she sees her PCP:
[ ] Lantus 70 U at bedtime
[ ] Humalog: 20 units at breakfast, 20 units at lunch, 20 units 
at dinner, and 8 units at bedtime

# Vaginal bleeding: Stable/resolved. Likely in the setting of 
low platelets. Patient is pre-menopausal, and prior to 
development of ITP, she had regular periods every 4 weeks. 
Somewhat heterogenous endometrium was seen on CHA vaginal US. 
During her last admission, OBGYN was consulted and felt it was 
non-specific with low-suspicion for underlying malignancy. 
Norethindrone was discontinued at that time. Only light vaginal 
spotting was seen at last hospital discharge. Treated ITP as 
above. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
=============== 
# Steroid-induced Gastritis, Dyspepsia: Last admission, the 
patient was placed on pantoprazole 40mg QD and ranitidine 150mg 
PO BID for GI ppx iso steroid use due to new cramping epigastric 
discomfort. Likely gastritis I/s/o steroid use. H pylori 
serology positive, infection can be associated with worsening of 
ITP. She will need a repeat stool H. Pylori testing 2 weeks

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were seen at ___ for very 
low platelets and minor bleeding. Our hematology doctors saw ___ 
and recommended admission to the internal medicine service for 
medication management. You were given high dose steroids and 
platelet medications and your platelets saw a gradual increase 
by your discharge dates. Given improvement in your labs and lack 
of significant bleeding, your hematology and surgical teams feel 
that it is safe to continue your management on steroids at this 
time. In the future if your symptoms worsen, you may require 
surgery to remove your spleen.

While hospitalized, you received vaccines that will protect you 
against infections that are life threatening in the event that 
you need your spleen removed. You will need repeat vaccines 
based on a schedule listed below that you should discuss with 
your PCP.

Since you are now on high dose steroids, this will affect your 
blood sugars and your insulin regimen has been increased 
appropriately (see below). Please record your blood sugars with 
meals and at bedtime and bring this log to your PCP. You have 
also been started on antibiotics, Vitamin D, and acid reflux 
medication to prevent complications that can develop with 
steroid use. Please continue to take these medications as 
prescribed.

It is imperative that you see your PCP and attend your follow-up 
appointments listed below.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
========
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of colonic polyp, 
chronic hepatitis B infection, coronary artery disease, 
ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p ICD, colonic polyps, not on blood 
thinners, and no history of GI bleed, who presented with acute 
GI bleed. He was initially admitted to the MICU because of 
elevated lactate and downtrending H/H despite 2u pRBCs 
transfused. Patient was stable in ICU overnight after admission 
and was called out to medicine floor the next day. He underwent 
colonoscopy before coming to medicine floor which 
re-demonstrated known diverticular disease and a polyp but 
showed no evidence of active bleeding. On ___ patient continued 
to have bloody bowel movements and was transfused an additional 
unit of pRBCs. A CTA abd/pelvis was performed to look for an 
occult source of bleeding which did not find a source of active 
bleeding. He continued to have BRBPR ___ and was transfused an 
additional 1u pRBCs. H/H uptrended ___ and remained stable 
through the day of discharge. Patient had ongoing small amounts 
of dark colored stool during the ___ days prior to discharge. 
GI felt the picture was most consistent with a resolving lower 
GI bleed, possibly in the right colon given report of melena. 
On day of discharge patient was asymptomatic and 
hemodynamically stable saving mild tachycardia thought 
attributable to beta blocker withdrawal and improved after 
restarting home metoprolol.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
-Discharge Hgb: 9.6
[] Renal aneurysm mildly increased compared to prior. Should 
have repeat imaging as outpatient to follow up.
[] Will need repeat colonoscopy in ___ months, with polyp
removal
[] Patient's hgb stabilized prior to discharge at 9.6. Repeat 
CBC should be obtained on ___.
[] Patient's home aspirin held given recent GI bleed. Should be 
reinitiated at PCP's discretion.
[] Patient with mild intermittent tachycardia during course of 
hospitalization thought secondary to held metoprolol. 
Metoprolol reinitated prior to discharge. Heart rate should be 
monitored during PCP follow up.
[] Patient with GI bleed without clear source, but thought 
secondary to resolved lower GI bleed. Should patient have 
additional episode of BRBPR, patient should be re-evaluated by 
gastroenterology. 
 
ACUTE ISSUES  
===============  
# GI Bleed, presumed lower
# Acute blood loss anemia:
Etiology initially felt to most likely be diverticular. 
Underwent colonoscopy ___ which again demonstrated 
diverticulosis and a 4 mm polyp but no active bleeding. ___
patient  continued to have bloody bowel movements so a CTA was
obtained  without evidence of active bleeding. Continued to have
bloody  bowel movements with downtrending H/H ___ requiring
additional  transfusion. As of ___ patient's H&H stabilized and
patient  tolerated a regular diet. Patient was monitored for
additional  time given ongoing dark colored stool which GI felt
was most  consistent with residual blood from likely resolving
lower GI  bleed without need for additional diagnostic studies
inpatient.  Patient required 3 units pRBCs transfused during
admission, with last blood transfusion on ___.

# Tachycardia
Patient noted to be tachycardic on admission. Thought most 
likely from intravascular depletion. Initially resolved with 
transfusions and IVF; however, tachycardia recurred on ___ 
likely in the setting of held home metoprolol and resulting 
beta blocker withdrawal. Hgb was otherwise stable, EKG was 
consistent with sinus tachycardia, and patient was without any 
additional symptoms concerning for acute GI bleed. Patient was 
reinitiated on home metoprolol with improvement and plan for 
follow up with PCP in the outpatient setting. 

# Lactic acidosis 
Lactate 5.6 in ED, improved to 1.6 after transfusions and IVF. 
Likely poor perfusion from volume depletion.

# Thrombocytopenia: 
Initially low ___ but improved 170's on day of discharge. 
Unclear etiology possibly liver dysfunction from chronic HCV 
versus consumptive process in setting of bleed.

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
===============  
# Coronary artery disease, LAD TO, LCx 60% ___
# HFrEF, ischemic, ___ s/p ICD placement
ICD placed ___ and recently interrogated ___ with 
acceptable battery life and stable chronic lead parameters. 
While acutely bleeding his home aspirin, furosemide, 
irbesartan, and spironolactone were held. Metoprolol 6.25mg Q6H 
was initially continued but held on ___. On discharge, 
patient had been reinitiated on furosemide, spironolactone, 
losartan (irbesartan not on formulary in hospital; therefore 
losartan initiated at equivalent does), and metoprolol. 
Patient's aspirin was held on discharge with PCP made aware.

# Chronic hepatitis B infection
Liver biopsy in ___ showed stage I liver fibrosis. His most 
recent LFTs are normal with normal ALT and AST. Continued 
entecavir 0.5 mg daily for viral suppression

# Hyperlipidemia
Continued rosuvastatin 40mg daily

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  

WHY WERE YOU IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You were admitted to the hospital because you were having 
bloody bowel movements

WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?  
-You were given blood and fluids to replace what you had lost.
-You were initially admitted to the ICU for close monitoring 
then transferred to a general medicine floor once it was 
determined that you were more stable.
-You had a colonoscopy which showed diverticula (outpouchings of 
your colon) and a small polyp but no source of active bleeding. 
You continued to have bloody bowel movements so we performed a 
CT scan of your abdomen which also did not find the source of 
your bleeding.
-Ultimately it was felt that your bleeding was likely from one 
of your diverticula and ended up stopping on it's own. We feel 
that the ongoing dark bowel movements you had on the day you 
left the hospital were likely your body getting rid of old 
blood. Once we felt that you had truly stopped bleeding and your 
blood counts were stable, you were discharged home.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AFTER YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
- Continue to take all your medicines as prescribed below. 
- Show up to your appointments as listed below.
- Return to the emergency room if you have any of the danger 
signs listed below.
- Monitor your stools at home. If you notice bright red blood in 
the toilet or loose, black stools, you should present to the 
emergency department as this may indicate a second bleed.

We wish you the best!  

Sincerely,  

Your ___ Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M who presented to ___ s/p fall 
from roof.  He had +LOC and he was found to have a small left 
pneumothorax, pulmonary contusions, b/l distal radius fractures, 
splenic laceration with pseudoaneurysm . In the ED, the 
patient's right wrist was reduced by orthopedic surgery and both 
wrists were splinted.  The patient was taken to Interventional 
Radiology and attempted distal splenic artery embolization, 
however during the procedure, the patient moved his leg and 
tried to get off the table and he developed a proximal splenic 
artery disection. He, therefore, underwent splenic embolization 
proximally with a large plug.  The procedure went well.  HCTs 
were trended and the patient received 1u PRBC.  After 1U PRBC, 
HCT remained stable. The patient had repeat imaging, including a 
CTA on HD3 and HD7 which demonstrated decrease in the size of 
the retroperitoneal hematoma and that the splenic artery 
reconstitutes distal to the Amplatzer plug through collateral 
vessels. Once HCTs were stable, the patient was started on a 
regular diet which he tolerated well.  Given that the patient is 
on methadone at home, the Chronic Pain Service was consulted and 
medication recommendations were provided and implemented.   

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

PERTINENT IMAGING/STUDIES: 
==========================
___ CXR (Portable): 
IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the 
monitoring and support devices are unchanged.  The a OG tube 
extends to the upper stomach, though the side port appears to be 
at the level of the esophagogastric junction.  The tube should 
be pushed forward several cm for optimal positioning. The 
patient has taken a better inspiration.  Opacification at the 
left base most likely represents atelectasis.  Opacification at 
the right base medially could also represent atelectatic 
changes.  However, either or both of these could represent 
developing aspiration pneumonia in the appropriate clinical 
setting. 
 
___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence for acute intracranial abnormalities. 

___ CT SPINE W/O CONTRAST: 
1. No evidence for a fracture. 
2. Minimal retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 is most likely 
degenerative, though 
there are no comparison exams to confirm chronicity. 
3. Mild multilevel degenerative disease. 

___ CT CHEST ABD/PELVIS W/ CONTRAST: 
IMPRESSION:  
1.  No fracture or acute traumatic injury. 
2.  Bilateral aspiration in lower lobes of lungs. 
3.  Hepatic lesions enhancing similar to portal vein could be 
large 
hemangiomas.  Recommend further evaluation with ultrasound. 
4.  Hepatosteatosis. 

___ Shoulder and knee xrays - no fracture

Abdominal ultrasound ___:
1. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease 
including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot 
be excluded on the basis of this examination. 
2. A 2.2 cm hypoechoic lesion in the right lobe liver dome 
likely corresponds to one of the hyperenhancing lesions seen on 
prior CT.  Appearance is not the typical echogenic appearance of 
hemangioma.  Differential includes atypical appearance of 
hemangioma, hematoma, or other primary liver lesions.  
___ MRI is recommended for further characterization. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  ___ MRI is recommended for further 
characterization. 

___ Lumbar MRI:
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Mild degenerative changes throughout the lumbar spine with no 
significant 
spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. 
2. Disc bulge at ___ abuts but does not displace the 
transiting right S1 
nerve root.  Recommend correlation with right S1 radiculopathy. 
3. ___ and incompletely imaged/characterized oblong, 
oval signal 
abnormality in the left psoas muscle, with no enhancement seen 
on the recently performed CT, potentially representing a small 
intramuscular hematoma in the setting of trauma, however there 
is no significant surrounding edema pattern and the lesion does 
appear fairly ___.  Recommend a ___ 
___ with ___ lumbar spine MRI 2 document the 
absence of an underlying mass lesion. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  ___ lumbar spine MRI for 
further 
evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of ETOH abuse and 
withdrawal seizures, depression, anxiety, and hypertension, who 
presented with ETOH intoxication, seizures, and respiratory 
failure. He was intubated in the ED due to concern for airway 
protection in the setting of seizure activity and ETOH 
withdrawal, now extubated and on phenobarbital taper.

# ETOH ABUSE & WITHDRAWAL
Recurrent, heavy use c/b withdrawal seizures. Recent 
psychosocial stressor includes divorce. He was started on the 
Phenobarb protocol with Ativan for breakthrough while in the 
ICU. He was also given IV thiamine, folate, and MVI. Social work 
was consulted for additional support. Depression and anxiety 
were treated, as below.  Upon arrival to the floor, he has no 
further symptoms of withdrawal.

# SEIZURES:
Patient presented with ___ activity, thought to be due 
to recurrent ETOH withdrawal in the setting of recent heavy use. 
Head CT and MRI showed no evidence of structural disease. No 
other metabolic cause was identified. Neurology was consulted, 
and he was placed on EEG. While in the ICU, he had ___ 
activity x1, but EEG was consistent with pseudoseizures. He was 
initially started on Keppra 500mg BID, which was weaned off on 
___. Neurology recommended that patient be monitored with 
continuous video EEG monitoring until off phenobarbital.  
Suspect pseudoseizure, especially given that patient had high 
EtOH and was placed on phenobarb making breakthrough seizure 
less likely.  No antiepileptic medications were recommended at 
discharge.  No driving for 6 months.

# HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS:
Patient was extubated on ___ without difficulty, and was 
transitioned to nasal cannula. He was treated for CAP, as below.

# Community acquired pneumonia: 
Patient aspirated during seizures, and had evidence of pneuomina 
on admission CXR, so he was treated with a ___ course of 
CTX/Azithro (Day 1 was ___. 

# TRAUMA with left shoulder pain.
Patient had been found at the bottom of a flight of stairs, 
parents do not think he fell down many since no thud heard but 
history unclear. CT torso and Cspine imaging without clear 
injury. After extubation, he had left shoulder pain. This in 
fact predated this injury as he timed it to a recent skiing 
accident.Shoulder ___ showed no acute fracture. He was left 
in ___ collar but then subsequently cleared by orthopedics 
on ___. His pain was controlled with Toradol, and 
Acetaminophen, with Morphine, but with inadequate pain control.  
He was transitioned to oxycodone (given one week supply), 
flexeril and ibuprofen at the day of discharge.  He was advised 
to follow up with orthopedics after discharge.

# Right leg weakness.
On neurologic exam, he was found to have right leg weakness, as 
well as right inner thigh numbness.  The neurology team 
localized this to a possible L1 injury.  He underwent lumbar MRI 
which showed a possible S1 disk protrusion, but no L1 injury.  
He was discharged with neurology follow up in 2 weeks for 
___ and consideration of EMG if his weakness is persistent.

# DEPRESSION / ANXIETY
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended Seroquel 12.5 BID for 
anxiety.  As his follow up was not clear, this was not continued 
at discharge, and psychiatric care can be pursued as an 
outpatient.  

# Hepatic hemangiomas and steatosis: LFTs were monitored. 

# HTN: amlodipine restarted on ___, restarted hctz/lisinopril 
at discharge.

Transitional issues:
Alcoholism - advised not to drive for 6 months after unclear 
seizure.  Seen by social work and advised to follow up for 
therapy

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
======================
[] Would recommend close monitoring of heart rate and titration 
of beta blocker as needed. He is near the maximum dose of 
metoprolol, so if atrial tachycardia reoccurs, could consider 
diltiazem as he responded well to that when briefly on this as 
an inpatient (however would avoid if possible given systolic 
heart failure).

[] Please monitor volume exam and adjust diuretic dose as 
needed.

[] The patient has had recent falls at home. ___ evaluation here 
noted unstable gait and falls risk; recommended discharge to 
rehabilitation, but the patient refused. He was deemed to have 
capacity to make such a decision, so patient was discharged 
home. Please continue to assess falls risk, continue discussions 
with patient regarding safety at home.

[] INR subtherapeutic on day of discharge. According to his 
pharmacy, his home dose is 5mg per day. We administerd 7.5mg on 
day of discharge (___) with instructions to take 5mg per day 
thereafter. Please monitor INR and dose warfarin accordingly.

pseudomonas osteomyelitis complicated by fungemia who presented 
with lower extremity weakness and falls. This was felt to be 
secondary to atrial tachycardia with frequent pauses. A 
biventricular pacemaker was placed and rate control agents 
titrated. He was also slightly fluid overloaded, so the patient 
was diuresed to euvolemic.

ACUTE ISSUES
==============
# Symptomatic pauses s/p BiV PPM
# Atrial tachycardia
The patient has a history of afib/flutter with RVR, s/p prior 
ablations. He presented with weakness and telemetry monitoring 
was revealing for alternating atrial tachycardia and sinus 
rhythm with symptomatic conversion pauses. A biventricular 
pacemaker was placed on ___. He was continued on warfarin 
per his outpatient cardiologist, Dr. ___. Rate control 
medications were titrated and the patient was ultimately 
discharged on his prior metoprolol succinate dose of 200mg BID. 
Of note, telemetry showed that he was in NSR for several days 
prior to discharge.

# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure 
Prior echocardiography with EF 21%, mild-mod MR, and mild TR. 
The patient presented with mild volume overload as evidenced by 
___ edema in ___, elevated JVP, and crackles over the lung 
fields, as well as 4 kg above his previous discharge weight. He 
was diuresed down ___ with improvement of his physical exam. 
The patient was discharged on 40mg PO Lasix (increased from 
prior home dose of 10mg daily), metoprolol as discussed above, 
as well as home hyrdralazine and Isordil.

# Anemia 
Patient with documented hypoproliferative anemia and MGUS. 
Previously requiring blood transfusions during last admission. 
H/H this admission slightly lower than baseline but overall 
stable. Labs were consistent with mixed picture of mildly 
hypoproliferative marrow, anemia of chronic disease, and iron 
deficiency, without any signs of hemolysis. Hbg was 9.0 on day 
of discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES
====================
# CAD
There was no ischemia noted on a recent nuclear stress test 
___, although there was akinesis of the basal inferoseptum, 
basal-mid inferior and inferolateral walls on a ___ TTE. 
The patient was continued on home pravastatin 40mg and ASA 81mg.

# Stage 4 CKD
Baseline Cr 2.5. Chemistries and renal function were trended 
throughout admission. The patient was continued on home sodium 
bicarbonate 650 mg BID.

# PAD
S/p R AT angioplasty on ___. Per chart review, vascular 
surgery recommended post-op clopidogrel for one month 
post-operatively, but clopidogrel has been continued without 
clear indication. Per the patient's outpatient cardiologist, 
Plavix was discontinued.

# IDDM 
The patient was continued on long acting glargine, prandial 
insulin, and an insulin sliding scale. 

# BPH
The patient was continued on home finasteride and tamsulosin.

diverticulosis/LGIB but patient has never had colonoscopy. 
Initial plan for endoscopy deferred per patient's wishes. Hct 
stable s/p 2u pRBC. Supratherapeutic INR was reversed with 
vitamin K and Kcentra. Baseline anemia likely from to be 
AICD/CKD with component of iron deficiency. Patient's bleed 
stabilized off warfarin. Risk/benefit discussion was offered 
regarding restarting Coumadin, holding Coumadin, or a trial of 
heparin to watch for re-bleed. Patient prefers to hold Coumadin 
until seeing PCP. She expressed understanding of the risk of 
stroke. She received a b12 shot on ___ and was started on daily

was negative for fracture as well. She had significant soft 
tissue swelling, ecchymosis. Supportive care with elevation and 
ice was offered. Podiatry recommended a surgical shoe and can 
follow up as an outpatient. Patient's oxycodone frequency was 
increased to q4h. 

# Depression
- continued wellbutrin 150mg

# ___ on CKD: Patient's base line CR 2.0-2.2. Discharged at 2.4, 
which has been stable.

# A-Fib: Warfarin was reversed with K-centra and vitamin K as 
above. Per patient preference, she wanted to discuss restarting 
anticoagulation with her PCP. She was continued on digoxin and 
metoprolol

# Diabetes  
- Continued home Glargine + ISS

weekly for whether patient's diuretic regimen can be changed. 
Discharged on 60 mg Torsemide PO BID
[ ] Please monitor CBCs weekly for anemia
[ ] Note patient is a difficult lab draw. She had a PICC line in 
place for her hospitalization. 
[ ] Discuss re-starting Coumadin for Afib.  In setting of recent 
bleed, would suggest avoiding triple therapy. Per WOEST trial, 
could consider Clopidogrel/Coumadin or by extension, 
prasugrel/Coumadin
[ ] Patient adamantly refuses colonoscopy. Consider alternative 
method of colon cancer screening given family history. 
[ ] Encourage supportive measures to reduce foot swelling
[ ] Titrate oxycodone back to q6hrs or even further spaced out 
as foot swelling resolves
[ ] Consider restarting spironolactone if creatinine stable
[ ] Attempt to stop omeprazole after 1 month

IMAGING: 
CXR ___
Subtle opacity projecting over the left upper lobe which could 
represent 
pleural parenchymal scarring.  However, oblique views are 
recommended for 
further evaluation to exclude a pneumonia. 

ECHO ___
PreTAVR Deployment
 Study is quite limited given large hiatal hernia and poor echo 
views especially transgastric and deep transgastric.
 The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is 
seen in the body of the left atrium. Regional left ventricular 
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). RV with normal free wall 
contractility. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. 
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are 
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The number of aortic 
valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets 
are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area <1.0cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. These findings were 
discussed with Drs. ___, and ___ at the time 
of exam.
PostTAVR Deployment
 There is a well-seated TAVR valve in place. Trace paravalvular 
regurgitation is noted. No new LV regional wall motion 
abnormalities are seen. Peak gradient is 9mmHg across the valve. 
The rest of exam is unchanged from prior. These findings were 
discussed with the procedural team at the time of exam in the 
operating room.  

ECHO ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and 
regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 63 %). Doppler 
parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left 
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal 
motion/position consistent with right ventricular 
pressure/volume overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. An ___ aortic 
valve bioprosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is 
normal for this prosthesis. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is 
probably present. The aortic valve VTI = 59 cm. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: A well seated aortic ___ valve is present with 
normal gradients and trace paravavluar aortic regurgitation.

Acute Issues:
=============
#Acute Kidney Injury 
#Concern for Hepatorenal syndrome 
The patient was discharged ___ from ___ on midodrine for 
management of acute kidney injury felt to possibly be secondary 
to hepatorenal syndrome. She was readmitted from clinic for 
increased ascites and need for a paracentesis. At that point, 
her Creatinine was lower than at her prior discharge (1.6 from 
1.9). She underwent a paracentesis ___. Creatinine then 
gradually increased. She was given IV albumin, octreotide and 
midodrine. Unfortunately her Creatinine continued to uptrend. 
She was then ruled in for the terlipressin trial on ___ and 
was enrolled into the study. However, her Creatinine did not 
improve while on the terlipressin trial. She was taken off of 
the study medication and restarted on midodrine and octreotide 
with ongoing worsening of her creatinine. Following several 
conversations with her family, decision was ultimately made to 
transition to CMO and she was discharged to a ___ facility. 
Her pain and comfort were treated aggressively.

#NASH Cirrhosis 
#Ascites
The patient was due for outpatient paracentesis on ___ 
however unfortunately had rapid reaccumulation of ascites and 
required a paracentesis sooner. She underwent a 6L paracentesis 
on ___ which significantly improved her symptoms. Diagnostic 
tap was negative for evidence of SBP. Due to her enrollment into 
the terlipressin trial, she was not tapped again until ___ 
when the trial was discontinued. She had another repeat 
paracentesis on ___ due to rapid reaccumulation. She was 
continued on ciprofloxacin prophylaxis while in the hospital. 
pleurX catheter was placed on ___ when she was transitioned to 
CMO. 

#Non-AGMA
Felt to be due to renal failure. She was started on oral 
bicarbonate but this was discontinued when she was made CMO.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==========================
#Diabetes. Home oral agents were held. She was placed on ISS but 
this was discontinued with transition to CMO

SUMMARY STATEMENT
=================
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a prior history of 
borderline hypertension and recurrent strep pharyngitis who 
presents with pharyngitis and chest pain and was found to have 
ECG changes and troponin elevation consistent with 
myopericarditis. A TTE revealed depressed LVEF of 40%. He did 
not show evidence of hemodynamic compromise, heart failure 
decompensation, conduction abnormality, or arrhythmia. His 
troponins started downtrending within 12 hours of admission. He 
was discharged on treatment for presumed bacterial pharyngitis 
and pericarditis.

====================
ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES
====================
#Myopericarditis with global LV dysfunction (LVEF 40%) 
Mr. ___ presented with clinical signs of pericarditis 
(pleuritic chest pain) and ECG evidence of pericaridits as well. 
Troponins were elevated confirming concomittant myocarditis. A 
coronary angiography did not show coronary disease. Left heart 
catheterization did show elevated LVEDP of 21, and a TTE showed 
global LV dysfunction with LVEF 40%. He did not show signs of 
hemodynamic compromise, heart failure decompensation, conduction 
abnormality, or arrhythmia, despite evidence of elevated filling 
pressures. 

Etiology very likely to be related to recent pharyngitis 
infection, especially given concurrent pericarditis. There is 
case-report evidence of strep pharyngitis-associated myocarditis 
and pericarditis. He received IV toradol and steroids, and was 
started on a nitroglycerin and heparin gtt in the ED and his 
chest pain resolved. He did not have recurrent chest pain. 

Utox negative, few eosinophils on peripheral smear. Mild 
presentation not consistent with giant cell myocarditis. No 
other evidence of endocarditis. His cardiac biomarkers, 
including CK-MB and troponin T, were downtrending during his 
admission. Limited repeat TTE on the day of discharge showed 
stable mild LV dysfunction. Review of his telemetry revealed on 
occasional premature atrial depolarizations without any 
sustained supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias and no 
evidence of heart block. For treatment of his pharyngitis and 
myopericarditis:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you while you were admitted to ___ 
___. 

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- You were having throat pain and chest pain. 

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?
- We found that you have inflammation of the heart muscle, and 
of the sack the surrounds the heart: this is called myocarditis 
and pericarditis. 
- Because your symptoms can be consistent with a heart attack, 
we did a procedure to look at the vessels in the heart (coronary 
angiography). This did not show any blockages or narrowing. 

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN YOU GO HOME?
- You are still at risk for cardiac complications. If you have 
difficult breathing, swelling in your legs, worsening fatigue, 
feeling lightheaded, call a doctor right away. You need to call 
___ or go to an emergency department if it feels like your heart 
is beating strangely or too fast, or if you pass out at any 
time. 
- Do not do any exercise until you see a doctor who tells you 
this is ok. Normal household activities are fine to do. 
- Buy a scale and take your weight every morning after getting 
up. If your weight goes up 3 pounds in a day or 5 pounds in a 
week, call your doctor right away. Your weight when you left the 
hospital was  209 pounds (94.8 kilograms). 
- Carefully review the attached medication list. 

Sincerely, 
Your ___ Care Team

not encephalopathy was contributing. Sphincter tone was noted to
be intact. As per discussion with patient and family,
incontinence has been intermittent at home, lasting a few days 
at
a time, then spontaneously resolving with asymptomatic periods 
in
between. Patient is a poor historian but noted that urge to
defecate comes on quick and doesn't have time to get to the
bathroom. Denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers. 

Patient noted that he was otherwise feeling well and denied any
other complaints. Noted that he is trying to eat healthy, and
denied weight change. Reported that his family was doing well so

RELEVANT STUDIES
=======================
___ TTE:
The left atrial volume index is normal. The right atrium is 
mildly enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial septal 
defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional 
and global left ventricular systolic function. Quantitative 
biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 66 %. Left 
ventricular cardiac index is high (>4.0 L/min/m2). There is no 
resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Tissue Doppler 
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP less 
than 12mmHg). Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with mild 
global free wall hypokinesis. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is depressed. The aortic sinus is mildly 
dilated with mildly dilated ascending aorta. The aortic arch 
diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic 
regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal with no 
mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There 
is mild [1+] tricuspid
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated right ventricle with mild free wall 
hypokinesis and mild pulmonary hypertension. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/ 
global systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY:
================
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old female with past medical history 
significant for autoimmune hepatitis s/p liver transplant ___, 
___ on tacrolimus and prednisone, recurrent DVTs on warfarin, 
and ulcerative colitis on mesalamine who presented to ___ 
with acute onset RUQ and epigastric pain and nonbloody vomiting 
on ___ found to have GPC bacteremia and imaging concerning for 
cholangitis. She underwent ERCP which showed a right 
intrahepatic stricture with upstream biliary scalloping and 
atypical cells on brushings. She received IV ceftriaxone/flagyl 
(D1 = ___, which were continued at discharge. 

ACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED:
======================
#Cholangitis 
#Transaminitis
#Strep anginosus blood stream infection
MRCP concerning for cholangitis and patient now with 2 blood 
culture bottles positive for GPCs now speciated as strep 
angiosus (___ group). Likely cholangitis with bacterial 
translocation. Clinically stabilized with antibiotics. She 
underwent ERCP ___ which showed R intrahepatic stricture with 
upstream biliary scalloping suggestive of cholangiopathy. Ddx 
includes ischemic stricture with secondary cholangiopathy, PCS 
and malignancy. Hepatitis serologies obtained, she is hep A and 
B non-immune and should have vaccinations, EBV negative and CMV 
VL non detectable. ___, AMA, ___ obtained and all negative. 
Cytology of brushings showed atypical cells, possibly consistent 
with PCS infection vs malignancy. She will require repeat 
brushings with her next ERCP 1 month after the first one. IgG 
subclasses obtained and IgG subclass 2 low. ___ consulted for 
drainage of bilomas seen on MRCP and deemed no intervention 
necessary at this time s/p ERCP. She was continued on 
ceftriaxone/flagyl (___), with plan for duration likely ___ 
weeks to be determined by ___ clinic follow up. She will 
require repeat ERCP in 4 weeks from ___.

#Autoimmune hepatitis s/p liver transplant ___: 
Patient with history of AIH s/p liver transplant in ___ at 
___. Tacro levels have been elevated to >15. The dose was 
downtitrated given goal trough this far out from transplant is 
usually ___, however further management deferred to outpatient 
hepatologist. She additionally has continued on budesonide for 
years, which was discontinued as it was unclear if patient had 
ongoing UC. She has also been on prednisone 10mg daily (recently 
downtitrated to 5mg daily in setting of recent dx DM). For 
immune suppression, lowered tacro to 1 mg BID from 1.5 mg BID at 
home given high levels. She was continued on pred 5mg daily. 
Contacted her transplant clinic (Dr. ___, at ___ 
___. Follow up appointment was made and informed 
patient of need for repeat ERCP. If ___ unable to follow up 
she will need f/u ERCP at ___ in four weeks. Transitionally, 
she should get repeat hep B vaccination (has had difficulty 
serocoverting in past); she should also get the hep A vaccine. 

#Tachycardia
Sinus tachycardia. Initially concerning for sepsis though 
patient is well appearing and adequately fluid resuscitated. 
Also component of rebound tachycardia from holding home 
metoprolol. She was given IVF and resumed on home metoprolol. 

#Electrolyte Abnormalities 
#Hypomagnesemia
#Hypokalemia
#Hypophosphatemia
Mg was 1.0 on arrival. Continued to waste Mg and K throughout. 
Hypomagnesemia is common in patients who have received solid 
organ transplants on tacrolimus Her 24 h urine collection was 
difficult to interpret in setting of repletion, but per renal 
likely represents increased urinary wasting in setting of 
hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Omeprazole may also play role in 
electrolyte disturbance, now switched to ranitidine. She is 
being discharged on BID magnesium supplementation and daily 
potassium supplementation. 

#DM2: Diagnosed 1.5 weeks prior to admission with ___, no hx of 
previous prediabetes. A1c 12%. She was restart glargine given 
hyperglycemia, recent DKA and 5 units Humalog TID w/ meals with 
insulin sliding scale. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
================
#HTN: 
Once stabilized, resumed home amlodipine 10mg and home 
metoprolol tartrate 75mg BID.

#Ulcerative Colitis: Resumed home Mesalamine 800mg TID. Held 
home budesonide given uncertainty of diagnosis.

#CAD: pravastatin 40mg daily 
#Recurrent DVT: resumed warfarin 72 hr s/p ERCP without a 
bridge. US study negative for DVT. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
#Cholangitis 
#Atypical brushings
Cytology brushings were abnormal from right intrahepatic biliary
branches: ""Atypical ductal epithelial cells and bile pigment.""
Differential includes ischemic stricture with secondary
cholangiopathy, PCS, and malignancy. 
[] Repeat ERCP 4 weeks from ___ to reassess/remove stent. 
Needs to be coordinated with home ___ 
___
[] Will need repeat biopsies on repeat ERCP to follow up 
atypical cells found on first set of brushings. Per Dr. ___, 
___ need
repeat biopsies of this area at next ERCP in ___. 

#Electrolyte disturbances

further workup outpatient.
[] Should follow up CMP one week of discharge while on repletion 
of K, Mg (please obtain on ___. 
[] Discharging on 800mg Magnesium Oxide BID and 20mEq K daily. 

#DVTs
[] INR to be followed up by PCP ___. MD). Pt 
has received 7.5mg of Warfarin for the last 4 days of her 
hospitalization. Last INR was 1.5.

#Diabetes:
[] Blood sugars should be closely monitored with titration of 
insulin as needed. 

#S/p liver transplant
[] Tacrolimus dose has been reduced to 1mg BID. Levels should be 
monitored closely and dosage adjusted as needed. Goal Tacro 
trough ___.

#Possible Ulcerative Colitis:
[] Budesonide for ulcerative colitis was stopped as patient 
already on significant immunosuppression with prednisone and 
tacro.
[] Patient should undergo colonoscopy as outpatient to determine 
activity of UC.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___, G1, P1, who had a spontaneous 
vaginal delivery on the morning of ___. Over the course 
of her labor, she had developed chorioamnionitis and was being 
treated with ampicillin and gentamicin. Following her delivery, 
she initially had a small amount of blood loss. However, she was 
then noted to have persistent vaginal bleeding.  Manual 
evacuation was performed initially at the bedside.  However, the 
patient continued to have significant vaginal bleeding due to 
uterine atony and there was a question of possible retained 
placenta and the decision was made to proceed to the operating 
room. She was found to have lower uterine atony and no evidence 
of retained placenta. She had a D&C and a bakri balloon placed 
with subsequently improved bleeding. She also received cytotec, 
Pitocin, hemabate, and methergine. Total blood loss in the labor 
and delivery room was estimated to be 1000 cc. She received 2 
units of packed RBCs with a subsequent hematocrit of 21.4. 

Post-partum she developed ___ likely due to hypovolemia which 
steadily improved. She had her bakri removed with stable 
bleeding. She completed 24 hours of ampicillin, gentamicin, and 
clindamycin.  

On ___ patient was discharged home in stable condition with 
appropriate follow-up scheduled.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you here at ___. 

Why you were here: 
- You were having chest pain that was reminiscent of your prior 
heart attacks. 

What we did: 
- We did a cardiac catheterization and found that 2 of your 
stents had become blocked off. These were opened up with new 
stents in the RCA and LAD. We also placed a third stent at the 
apex of the heart.

What to do when you go home: 
- It is important to take both aspirin and Plavix every day 
without missing any doses. If you miss any doses your stent 
could clot off and cause another heart attack. 
- Follow up with Dr. ___ your primary care doctor. 
- Please weigh yourself every day and call your doctor if you 
gain more than 3 lbs. 
- Return to the ER or call your doctor if you notice recurrent 
chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, leg swelling, or any 
other symptoms that concern you.  

We wish you the best! 

Sincerely, 
Your Care Team

___ Liver Duplex:
IMPRESSION: 
 
Patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate waveforms.

___ CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic 
abnormality.
2. Moderate volume left-sided pleural effusion with relaxation 
atelectasis and collapse of the left lower lobe.
3. Intercostal approach right pigtail drainage catheter is 
entirely fissural,
starting in the minor, ending in the major.  Right pleural 
effusion is
minimal.  No pneumothorax
4. Multifocal opacities, some of which demonstrate ground-glass 
attenuation
are present throughout both lungs.  Possible etiologies include 
multifocal
pneumonia, aspiration or less likely pulmonary hemorrhage.

___ TTE:
IMPRESSION: Poor image quality. Normal left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function. 

___ CXR:
IMPRESSION: 
 
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little 
interval change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Deceased donor liver transplant with supraceliac aortic arterial 
conduit and repair of right diaphragm, ___.  Surgeons were 
Dr. ___ Dr. ___ with an intraoperative consult to Dr. 
___.  Intraoperative fluids: Cell Saver 160 cc, crystalloid 3 
L, Plasma-Lyte 1 L, albumin 1 L.  Post-operative chest x-ray 
revealed PA in right main pulm artery, NG tube in stomach, ETT 
in between clavicle and carina. Left lung field minor 
atelectasis. No pleural effusion or PTX. Post op liver U/S: 
Patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate waveforms.  The 
patient was resuscitated appropriately in the SICU. Antibiotics 
were discontinued after 24 hour course, his ___ was exchanged 
for a triple lumen CVL, and he was called out to the floor on 
POD#2.  At this time his arterial line and foley catheter were 
also discontinued.
.
The patient received routine induction immunosuppression to 
include Mycophenolate 1 gram pre-op and continued at 1 gram BID 
with good GI tolerance. Intra-op he received 500 mg Solumedrol, 
and started the solumedrol to prednisone taper per pathway, 
however the prednisone taper rate of decrease was dropped to 
every 5 days (instead of every 7) due to anxiety and possible 
steroid role.
Tacro was started on the evening of POD 1 with daily levels and 
dose adjusted per level. Discharge level was 11.6 and he is 
discharged on 2 mg BID.
.
On POD#3 he was offered a regular diet.  His foley catheter was 
replaced after he failed to void, and he was diuresed with 
intravenous Lasix.  

On POD#4 he was found to have a new oxygen supplementation 
requirement, first 3L NC and progressing to 10 L. After being 
placed on a non-rebreather, he was transferred to the ICU for 
high flow nasal cannula.  CXR revealed opacification of the left 
hemithorax concerning for pleural effusion, and a pigtail chest 
tube was placed.  A CTA of the chest was negative for PE, and he 
was intubated due to persistent hypoxia.  A right sided pigtail 
chest tube was also placed.  A dobhoff feeding tube was placed, 
and tube feeds were initiated.  He underwent bronchoscopic 
evaluation, revealing thick yellow secretions  A BAL was sent 
and empiric vanc/cefepime for possible pneumonia was initiated.  


On POD#5 he was extubated and weaned down on high flow nasal 
cannula.  He tolerated a clear liquid diet. 

On POD#6 he was advanced to a regular diet.  His chest x-ray was 
improved from prior.  His foley catheter was still in place for 
accurate urine monitoring.

On POD#7, ___, he tolerated a regular diet plus tube feeds, his 
urine output was satisfactory, and he had no further ICU needs.  
His lateral JP drain was removed, and his left pigtail chest 
tube was removed.  His foley catheter was removed after a dose 
of IV Lasix.  He was called out to the floor in good condition.

On POD#8, He was tolerating a regular diet. ___ was 
monitoring his blood sugars and adjusting his insulin as needed. 


On POD#9, His LFTs were slightly increased and he underwent 
ultrasound of the liver which demonstrated patent vasculature 
and good waveforms. A CXR demonstrated small pleural effusions 
and he was give Lasix to help reduce his volume overload.

On POD#10, ___, his other JP drain was removed and his dobhoff 
tube was removed with cessation of supplemental feeding. He 
continued to require insulin and he completed a 7 day coruse of 
cefepime for possible pneumonia. 

ON POD#___, ___, his WBC continued to be elevated. He remained 
afebrile and there was never purulent material coming from his 
drains. He underwent CT Torso with IV/PO contrast, which 
demonstrated small left pneumothorax, heterogenous fluid on the 
right base, and right subcutaneous emphysema. From ___, he 
was monitored with continued large amount of serous drainage 
from his chest tube. However, the amount was slowly down over 
these days and by ___ it put out less than 200cc over 24 hours. 
His chest tube was removed and his post pull was without 
pneumothorax. During this time period, his insulin regimen 
continued to be adjusted for improved blood sugars. On ___, he 
was deemed appropriate for discharge after the appropriate 
insulin management teaching, pharmacy teaching, and general care 
teaching. He understands that if he has any questions or 
concerns to give the transplant office a call.

___ recommendations for managing Prednisone taper:
PREDNISONE & NPH tapered dosing as follows: 
15mg = 9 units 
12.5mg = 6 units
10mg = 6 units
7.5mg = 4 units
5mg = 4 units
2.5mg = 0 units (discontinue NPH) 
**Do not administer NPH insulin if you are not taking Prednisone
- both medications should be administered at the same time**

Humalog Sliding Scale - administer dose based on pre-meal
fingerstick blood glucose level (at B, L, D).  
71-150mg/dL = 0 units
151-200mg/dL = 2 units
201-250mg/dL = 3 units 
251-300mg/dL = 4 units 
> 300mg/dL = 5 units 
**Do not administer Humalog if you are not eating.**
 
Please call your provider (transplant team or primary care
physician) if you have frequent blood glucoses less than 70mg/dL
or frequent glucoses greater than 250mg/dL for possible
medication adjustments. Follow the Rule of 15 to treat
hypoglycemia (i.e. a blood glucose < 70mg/dL). Always carry
glucose tablets with you to treat a sudden low blood sugar.
