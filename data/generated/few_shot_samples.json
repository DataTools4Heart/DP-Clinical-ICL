Transferred from the MICU to the medicine floor \non ___ given resolving sepsis likely from sacral wound. He was \nstable on the medicine floor with waxing and waning orientation \n(likely his new baseline) requiring intermittent dialysis, pain \nmedicine, and anti-itching medicine.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n=============\n#Intubation d/t mental status\n#Hypercarbic respiratory failure now resolved\n#Chronic Aspiration\nPatient intubated ___ for airway protection iso worsening \nmental status. Multifocal opacities on CT Chest concerning for \naspiration pneumonitis vs pneumonia.  Discussions with wife \nthroughout course indicated that he would want everything done \nincluding trach/PEG if necessary; however of note he would \nrequire C-surg d/t complicated anatomy. He had a prolonged \nintubation due to excessive  secretions and poor mental status. \nHe was able to be extubated ___ and did well. His diet was \nadvanced slowly which he tolerated well. Diet at discharge was \nsoft solids, thin liquids, with 1:1 supervision.\n\n#Toxic metabolic encephalopathy\n#Epileptiform discharges on EEG\n#Altered mental status\n#CVA - right middle cerebellar peduncle\nMental status was poor despite completing treatment for \ninfection above. EEG over multiple days not consistent with \nseizure like activity. MRI brain revealed small punctate infarct \nin right middle cerebellar peduncle; however, this is unlikely \nto explain mental status. MRA with patent circle of ___ \narteries. Patient received keppra 500 BID with extra 500 post \ndialysis on MWF. He received atorvastatin and ASA for CVA risk. \nPlavix was held in setting of bleeding. Neurology and vascular \nsurgery both agreed that Plavix can be discontinued. \n\n# ESRD on ___ HD: \nReceived CRRT due to hypotension; renal followed. Patient was \ntransitioned back to MWF HD without complication. Requiring \nmidodrine TID for hypotension. \n\n# History of B fragilis blood stream infection\n# Chronic Stage IV Sacral Ulcer\n# Septic shock\n# Leukocytosis\n# Multifocal Pneumonia\nInitially leukocytosis with AMS and HD instability c/w septic \nshock. S/p abx for b fragilis ___ sacral wound. CT A/P, CT Head \nx2 negative CT Chest ___ revealing multifocal opacities w/ air \nbronchograms. CT findings likely represent inflammatory changes \nrelated to multiple aspiration events. Required levophed for \nhypotension as well as high dose midodrine. s/p Vanc, ceftaz, \nflagyl empirically ___ - ___. Fecal management system \n(flexiseal) placed to divert stool from open sacral wound and \nhelp with healing. Would need diverting colostomy for definitive \nwound repair, which wife states is absolutely NOT within GOC. \nWound care and ACS followed, recommended enzymatic debridement \nand ultimately placed wound vac. Plastic was not offering flap \nfor closure given comorbidities. On ___, pressor requirement and \nwhite count increased, started vanc/meropenem again given \nblue-green drainage from wound; wound culture grew pseudomonas. \nHe finished course of meropenem on ___. Patient also received \nstress dose steroids in the setting of sepsis. He remained \nstable without any other signs of infection through his hospital \nstay.\n\n# Anemia\n# Hematochezia \nChronic anemia due to renal disease, trended downward ___, with \nCT C/A/P without evidence of bleed. Stool dark and guiac \npositive making GI bleed most likely. Patient was too unstable \nat present to undergo scope. Had visualized melena and \nhematochezia earlier in admission iso likely hypotension/bowel \nischemia which had resolved but bleeding seems to have recurred \nwhile on asa/Plavix for CVA. Plavix was held and hemoglobin \nremained stable. Endoscopic evaluation was deferred. Patient \nreceived PO lansoprazole twice daily for two weeks. He had no \nmore episodes of GI bleeding through his stay and he was \ntransitioned to his home famotidine 20 mg daily. Hemoglobin was \nstable on discharge. \n\n# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus\nPatient was on insulin gtt in the ICU and transitioned to basal \ninsulin glargine 16u with Humalog insulin sliding scale.\n\n#SVT (resolved) \n#Likely MAT\nAppeared to have MAT on EKG while in MICU. Has intermittent \nepisodes of SVT into the 130s while on dialysis. Blood pressure \nhas been stable without any symptoms noted during episodes. Rate \ncontrol is being deferred given soft blood pressures and issues \nwith hypotension during HD. \n\nCHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES\n=======================\n#Nutrition: Began home tube feeds which was advanced\n\n#Transaminase elevation: He had a mild transaminase elevation \nlast admission in ___ thought to be ___ drug effect from \nantibiotics.\" Known to be HCV positive but not active given \nnegative surface antigen. No thrombosis or sign of chronic liver \ndisease on RUQUS. No hx of new drugs that would likely cause \nDILI. Intermittently hypotensive and likely ischemic \nhepatopathy. Resolved.\n\n# PVD: Held atorvastatin initially due to liver injury, \nrestarted atorvastatin after liver function normalized per \nneurology recommendations given vascular disease. Held \ngabapentin throughout his hospital stay due to mental status.\n\n#Gout: Continued allopurinol which was changed to every other \nday dosing on ESRD.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n[] Can likely stop keppra in ___ mo pending Neurology would like \nto see him as an outpatient and they will place EEG and wean him \noff his keppra. Please connect with ___ and Dr. ___ \n___ \n[] Consider EGD/colonoscopy for outpatient work up of GIB\n[] Needs Urology f/u ___ CT abd showing R renal 2x2 cm \nlesion\n[] No plan for flap closure giving need for diverting colostomy, \nbut if these plans are re-introduced ID would like to be \ninvolved to treat chronic sacral wound prior to any operation\n[] Will likely require ongoing goals of care discussions given \nchronic infections, multiple comorbidities and low likelihood of \nreturn to functional baseline\n\n#CODE STATUS: Full \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

        "prediction": "Based on the patient's medical record, it appears that the primary diagnosis is Pleural Effusion. The patient was admitted to the hospital due to a build-up of fluids in the lungs, which was diagnosed as pleural effusion.\n\nThe discharge instructions provided by the care team include:\n\n* Taking all medications as prescribed\n* Following up with doctors as listed\n\nHowever, there are some concerns and recommendations made during the patient's stay that need to be noted:\n\n* The patient experienced low blood pressure after drainage, which may require restarting certain medications.\n* The patient has a history of pyuria (elevated white blood cell count in urine) and was treated with antibiotics in the ED. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of this symptom.\n* The patient's creatinine levels were elevated initially but improved with IV fluids. However, it's unclear if this is related to dehydration or another underlying issue.\n* The patient has a history of anemia, which was trending during their stay.\n* The patient's blood pressure dropped below baseline after fluid removal, and their medications for hypertension (lisinopril and amlodipine) were held. However, it's unclear if this is related to the pleural effusion or another underlying issue.\n\nOverall, the care team recommends that the patient follow up with their doctors as listed and take all prescribed medications as directed.",

Further assessment with MRI is recommended.\n2.  Heterogeneous hyperdense asymmetric enlargement of the left \npsoas muscle at the level of the inferior left kidney, \ncompatible with a hematoma in the setting of known \nanticoagulation.\n3.  New moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent right lung \nbase\nconsolidation and atelectasis.  Superimposed infection is \nconsidered in the\nappropriate clinical setting.  Small left pleural effusion is \nrelatively\nunchanged.\n\n___ MRI SPINE: \n1. The study is degraded by motion artifact.\n2. Pathological fracture of the T12 vertebral body with relative \npreservation of the anterior and posterior vertebral body \nheights.  The central aspect of the vertebral body does not \nenhance in keeping with a pathological fracture most likely \nsecondary to infection.  There is enhancement of the adjacent \nparavertebral soft tissue and there is involvement of the \ninferior aspect of the T11 vertebral body.  These findings are \nmost consistent with a pathological fracture secondary \nto/destruction of the T12 vertebral body by osteomyelitis.\n3.  There is and associated mixed intensity collection the left \npsoas muscle most likely representing a psoas abscess.  The \nsignal intensity of the collection is slightly atypical for an \nabscess being T2 mixed Iso and hyperintense with a surrounding \nT2 hypointense rim and a psoas hematoma secondary to a \npathological fracture should be considered in the differential \ndiagnosis.\n4. Moderate severe spinal canal stenosis at the L3-___s moderate severe left L3-4 neural foraminal narrowing \ndescribed above.\n5. No compromise of the thoracic cord in the thoracic spinal \ncanal.\n6. Small epidural collection at T11-12.\n\nECHO: Suboptimal image quality. \n1) Image quality poor with this limitation in mind no \nechocardiographic evidence of endocarditis seen.\n2) Moderate pulmonary systolic arterial hypertension in setting \nof mild RV dilation and normal RV systolic longitudinal \nfunction. There is moderate tricuspid regurgitation and severe \nRA dilaton. LV e' velocities are high arguing against primary LV \npathology as cause of pulmonary hypertension. \n-The patient has a mildly dilated ascending aorta. Based on ___ \nACCF/AHA Thoracic Aortic Guidelines, if not previously known or \na change, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in ___ year; if \npreviously known and stable, a follow-up echocardiogram is \nsuggested in ___ years. \n\n___ MRI LEFT SHOULDER\n1. No findings specific for septic arthritis of the glenohumeral \njoint.  Trace to small glenohumeral joint effusion, could be \nrelated to rotator cuff pathology and biceps tendon tear, \nsuperimposed infection cannot be excluded.  If clinical concern \nfor septic arthritis, joint fluid sampling could be obtained.\n2. Moderate to high-grade articular surface tearing of the \nsupraspinatus\ntendon with additional full-thickness tear along the leading \nedge.\n3. Moderate tendinosis and interstitial tearing of the \ninfraspinatus tendon\nwith probable calcific tendinitis near its insertion. Recommend \ncorrelation with left shoulder radiographs.\n4. Likely complete tear of the intra-articular portion of the \nbiceps tendon\nwith retraction.\n5. Small amount of subacromial subdeltoid bursal fluid.\n6. Moderate degenerative type changes of the acromioclavicular \njoint.  No\nfindings specific for septic arthritis.\n7. Diffuse red marrow changes.\n\n___ SHOULDER XRAY: Degenerative changes.  No acute fracture \nis seen.  Some narrowing of the acromial humeral interval raises \npossibility of rotator cuff tear.\n\n___ CXR: Right PICC line tip most likely terminates in the \nproximal right atrium and should be pulled back 4 cm.  Patient \nis in pulmonary edema.  Right pleural effusion is moderate.  \nLeft pleural effusion is small.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly.\n\n___: MRI T/L-SPINE\n1. Discitis and osteomyelitis are again demonstrated T11-T12.  \nSevere collapse of T12 vertebral body and minimal T11 vertebral \nbody loss of height are unchanged.

Moderate to severe multifocal atherosclerotic disease \nthroughout the circle of ___, most pronounced in the \ncavernous internal carotid arteries and right posterior cerebral \nartery. \n4. No evidence of acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage. \n5. Small bilateral left greater than right cerebral convexity \nsubdural fluid collections/hygromas.  No significant mass \neffect. \n6. Chronic infarcts in the bilateral basal ganglia and pons. \n7. Mild parenchymal volume loss and probable moderate to \nextensive chronic \nsmall vessel ischemic disease. \n\n___ RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the right subclavian, \naxillary, and one of the paired brachial veins.  Notably, the \nright subclavian, axillary, and brachial veins are were occluded \non ___ right upper extremity ultrasound. \n\n___ CTA HEAD AND CTA NECK \n1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \n2. Stable left convexity hypodense 2 mm subdural collection. \n3. Corresponding to findings on MRA, there is near complete \nocclusion of the right internal carotid artery in the petrous \nsegment with flow distally and patent right MCA arborization. \n4. Severe stenosis and likely complete occlusion of the left M1 \nsegment at the carotid terminus although there does appear to be \nflow distally in the MCA arborization possibly due to \ncollaterals. \n5. Approximately 40 to 50% narrowing of the bilateral \nsupraclinoid internal \ncarotid arteries due to calcified atherosclerotic plaque. \n6. The posterior circulation appears patent without significant \nstenosis. \n7. Approximately 50% narrowing of the left internal carotid \nartery in the \ncervical segment by NASCET criteria. \n8. Right lung opacities suggest infectious or inflammatory \nprocess. \n9. 9 mm cavitary nodule in the right upper lobe could suggest \ntuberculosis, \nseptic embolus, or malignancy. Dedicated chest CT recommended. \n10. Markedly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. \n\n___ CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST\n1.  Multifocal opacities involving right upper/middle lobes and \nleft lower \nlobes, right greater than left with sparing of the left upper \nlobe suggest a multifocal infectious process predominantly \ncentering along airways and \nperibronchovascular parenchyma.  Additionally there is a small \nbut new \nperipheral nodule with cavitation in the right upper lobe.  \nAtypical organisms should be considered for this in addition to \nbacterial pneumonia.  New lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum in \neach hilum. \n2.  Persistent occlusive venous disease in the right upper \nextremity. \n\n___ TTE\nThe left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. There is no \nevidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The \nestimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is normal \nleft ventricular wall thickness with\na normal cavity size. There is mild-moderate left ventricular \nregional systolic dysfunction with XXX (see schematic) and \nmoderate global hypokinesis of the remaining segments. No \nthrombus or mass is seen in the\nleft ventricle. Quantitative 3D volumetric left ventricular \nejection fraction is 35 % (normal 54-73%). Due to severity of \nmitral regurgitation, intrinsic left ventricular systolic \nfunction is likely lower. Left ventricular cardiac index is \nnormal (>2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular \noutflow tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size \nwith moderate global free wall hypokinesis. Tricuspid annular \nplane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is depressed. The aortic sinus \ndiameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta \ndiameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a \nnormal descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) \nare mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There \nis no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear \nstructurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is \nmoderate mitral annular calcification. There is moderate to \nsevere [3+] mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the \nseverity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The \npulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. The tricuspid valve \nleaflets appear structurally normal. There is mild to moderate \n[___] tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \nregional and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction most \nconsistent with coronary artery disease or other diffuse \nprocess. Moderate to severe mitral regurtitation. Moderate \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Right\nventricular free wall hypokinesis. Compared with the prior TTE \n(images not available for review) of ___, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure is now increased. \n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient's LVEF is less than 40%; a \nthreshold for which they may benefit from a beta blocker and an \nACE inhibitor (or ___ and a mineralocorticoid receptor \nantagonist.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n====================\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: \n==================== \n___, ___, with h/o ESRD on ___ HD, type II \ndiabetes, asthma, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, coronary \nartery disease, HFrEF EF 35%, atrial fibrillation on warfarin \nwho presents with generalized weakness, fevers and epistaxis \nfound to have supratherapeutic INR, hyperkalemia and \ncommunity-acquired pneumonia. Given cavitation seen on CT chest \nand history of untreated latent TB, he underwent TB rule out \nwhich revealed 3x negative smear and negative TB nuclear acid \namplification test. Course was c/b acute-on-chronic RUE DVT, \ntoxic-metabolic encephalopathy, hypoxic respiratory failure \nsecondary to flash pulmonary edema, which all resolved by \ndischarge. Anticoagulation was changed from warfarin to \napixaban.

Per initial Hematology recommendation, bridged \nwith heparin then transitioned back to warfarin, goal INR ___. \nIt was difficult to achieve a stable INR during his hospital \ncourse and after discussion with renal team, transitioned him to \napixaban 5mg BID. He was discharged with 1 month supply.\n\n# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy\n# Transient aphasia\n# Multifocal intracranial stenosis\nPatient had apparent transient expressive aphasia on ___ in the \nsetting of receiving dialysis. However this was difficult to \nassess given concominant delirium, metabolic derangements and \nrequirement for ___ language interpreter. Neurology was \nconsulted and Code Stroke was called with reassuring workup. CT \nhead, MRI/MRA brain, and CTA head/neck which did not show acute \nstroke, but did demonstrate severe intracranial atherosclerotic \ndisease. Home atorvastatin was increased to 80mg. Continued on \nhome aspirin 81mg.\n\n# Diabetic retinopathy\nNeuro team noted monocular diplopia. He was followed up by \nophthalmology on ___ who noted moderate bilateral cataracts and \nmoderate-severe diabetic retinopathy. Recommended follow up in \nophthalmology clinic.\n\n# Rehab needs:\nSeverely reconditioned.  Pt originally refused transition to \nrehab preferring to return home with family.  Ultimately, pt \nagreed to plan for rehab as he recognized that he could not \nmanage at home until he gets stronger.\n\n# Heart with failure reduced ejection fraction (EF 38%)\n# Ischemic cardiomyopathy\n# Mild/moderate [___] TR\n# Severe (3+) MR\n# Atrial fibrillation \nTTE was repeated this admission due with EF 35%, 3+ MR, ___ TR. \nVolume managed with HD. Continued on home metoprolol. Digoxin \nheld while on azithro, resumed afterward. He is not on optimal \nmedical therapy for HFrEF. Per last cardiology note, he was \ninitiated on low-dose captopril previously but had hypotension \non HD days, then it was held and on another visit recommended \nrestarting it and holding on HD days. Did not restart while \ninpatient due to hypotension after HD, would resume if able as \nan outpatient. Anticoagulation per above.\n\n# Dyspnea/Chest tightness\nPatient complained intermittently of dyspnea which was thought \nmultifactorial from fluid overload, deconditioning, and asthma. \nEKGs were not concerning for active ischemia. He was treated for \nasthma as below.\n\n# Constipation\nStarted on bowel regimen which was uptitrated to miralax BID and \n2 tabs of senna BID, then started having loose stools. \nDischarged with daily miralax. Please monitor.\n\n# Elevated Lactate\n# Respiratory alkalosis\nHad an episode of respiratory distress iso fluid overload with \nrespiratory alkalosis and lactate of 8 which decreased without \nintervention, thought possibly related to poor renal clearance \nvs. type D from frequent\nnebulizer treatments.\n\n# Leukocytosis\nIntermittently elevated to 10 range, thought iso infection and \ninflammation.\n\n# Asthma\nContinued albuterol prn and fluticasone BID.

Severe cardiomegaly is chronic, \nprobably \nworsened.   \n\nTransvenous right ventricular pacer lead in standard placement.  \nNo \npneumothorax.   \n\nNew right PIC line ends in the right brachiocephalic vein just \nbefore the \norigin of the SVC, approximately 8.5 cm below the estimated \nlocation of the superior cavoatrial junction. \n\n___ TEE\n\nPRE-BYPASS\n\nThe patient is in sinus tachycardia and receiving milrinone 0.25 \nmcg/kg/min, vasopressin 2.4 units/hr, epinephrine 0.03 \nmcg/kg/min, and norepinephrine 0.025 mcg/kg/min.\n\nThe left atrium is markedly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in \nthe left atrium or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is \nmoderately dilated, pacing wires are seen in the RA and RV. No \natrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, \ncolor Doppler or saline contrast with Valsalva maneuvers. The \nleft ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left \nventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= ___ \n%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The \nright ventricular cavity is dilated there is mild hypokinesis of \nthe RV free wall worsening towards the apex. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \nexcursion. There is no aortic stenosis. There is trivial aortic \nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally \nnormal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild \nTR. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nPOST-BYPASS \n\nThe patient is in sinus tachycardia and receiving milrinone \n0.375 mcg/kg/min, vasopressin 2.4 units/hr, epinephrine 0.08 \nmcg/kg/min, and norepinephrine 0.03 mcg/kg/min. Inhaled \nepoprostenol is being administered at 0.05 mcg/kg/min. LVAD \nspeed is adjusted after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass \nwith a final speed of 9000 rpm. \n\nLV dysfunction remains severe. A well-positioned LVAD inflow \ncannula is seen in the LV apex directed towards the MV opening, \nwith inflow velocities < 2.0 m/s. The LVAD outflow cannula is \nappropriately positioned in the ascending aorta with velocities \n< ___ m/s. At an LVAD speed of 9000 rpm the interventricular \nseptum was midline to rightward bowing with partial LV \ndecompression. The aortic valve remained mostly closed at this \nspeed, with occasional partial leaflet opening. \n\nAfter discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass, the right \nventricular dysfunction was mild on the noted inotropic support. \nWith chest closure, the outflow graft appeared to compress a \nportion of the RV free wall, creating moderate dysfunction; \nhowever there were no significant changes in hemodynamic \nmeasurements, SVO2, or CI. \n\nThe thoracic aorta remains intact.\n\n___ TTE\n\nThe coronary sinus is dilated (diameter >15mm). Left ventricular \nwall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe \nglobal left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF <20 %). The right \nventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global free \nwall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The \naortic valve does not open. The mitral valve appears \nstructurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate \n[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial \neffusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nbiventricular systolic function is now more depressed, a \nHeartmate is now seen, and the aortic valve no longer opens\n\n___ CTA CORONARY ARTERY WITH 3D W/F\n\nADDENDUM  In addition to the previously reported findings and \nimpression:\nAn anterior mediastinal hematoma and potential pericardial \neffusion may also\ncontribute to compression of the anterior wall of the right \nventricle,\nsubstantial reduction in right ventricular volume, and \nflattening of the\ninterventricular septum compared to the pre-operative exam in \n___.  The\ndegree of mediastinal hematoma and pericardial effusion is \ndifficult to\ndistinguish on the current exam.\n \nRecommend repeating an echocardiogram to further evaluate, and \nconsider\nrepeating cardiac CTA depending on the patient's current \nclinical status.\n \nCorrection to the original report:  Smooth, circumferential \nfilling defect in\nthe inflow and outflow LVAD cannula is not partial thrombus but \nrather the\nexpected CT appearance of the cannula wall.\n\n___ LOWER EXT US \n\nNo evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower \nextremity\nveins.\n\n___ UPPER EXT US \n\nNonocclusive thrombus surrounding the pacemaker lead in the mid \nto distal left\nsubclavian vein.\n \nNo evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper extremity \nveins.\n\n___ CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST\n \nThere is a hyperdense collection measuring 77 x 56 mm in the \naxial plane and\n81 Hounsfield units seen in the left lateral chest wall in \nrelation to the\nserratus anterior muscle with associated air locules and \nsurrounding\nsubcentimeter lymph nodes suggestive of superimposed infection \n(on previous\nstudy done ___ there was a hematoma is seen in the \nleft serratus\nanterior muscle).  This process is remote from the LVAD.\n \nMetallic streak artifact obscures the soft tissue/ pump pocket \nsurrounding the\nLVAD, but there is no obvious ___ LVAD collection or \nextravasation of\ncontrast.\n \nThere is interval improvement in the anterior mediastinal \nhematoma and\nhemorrhagic left pleural effusion.\n \nA few air locules seen in the right atrium which is thought to \nbe secondary to\nair injection and not suggestive of mediastinitis.  However if \nthe clinical\nsuspicion for mediastinitis is high then a non contrasted CT may \nbe performed\nto exclude mediastinal air locules/mediastinitis with absolute \ncertainty.\n \nThe median position of the LVAD outflow tract is again noted \nwith mass effect\non the right ventricle, but there is less right atrial \ndistention and reflux\nof contrast into the hepatic veins compared to immediate \nprevious study done\n___.\n\n___ ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND\n\nNo focal collection identified in the area of tenderness as \nindicated by the\npatient.\n\n \n___ LEFT SHOULDER X RAY \n\nNormal left shoulder radiographs.\n\n___ CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST\n\nSingle air bubble likely within upper margin of the right \natrium; previously\nseen additional air bubbles have resolved.\n\n___ ECHOCARDIOGRAM \n\nThe right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right \nventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall \nhypokinesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+] \ntricuspid regurgitation is seen. [In the setting of at least \nmoderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to \na very high right atrial pressure.] \n\nIntermittent aortic valve opening is seen at 9200 RPM. At all \nhigher pump speeds, little or no aortic valve opening is seen. \nThe interventricular septum is in a leftward displaced \nconfiguration at all speeds higher than 9200 RPM (neutral at \n9000 and 9200 RPM), with severe tricuspid regurgitation and \nright ventricular dilation at all speeds. \n\n___ CT HEAD (episode of unresponsiveness)\n \nThere is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass.  \nThe\nventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration.\n \nThere is no evidence of fracture.  A mucous retention cyst is \nseen in the\nright maxillary sinus.  Remaining visualized paranasal sinuses, \nmastoid air\ncells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  The globes are \nunremarkable.\n \nIMPRESSION:\n\n1.

He\nrequired milrinone therapy and diuresis for optimization.  He \nwas\nnot a candidate for a heart transplant due to his\nmorbid obesity.  I was asked to evaluate him for\nconsideration of LVAD destination therapy.  The risks and\nbenefits of the operation were discussed with the patient, he\nconsented to proceed.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After the patient was placed under\nanesthesia and intubated, his chest, abdomen, and lower\nextremities were prepped with chlorhexidine and draped in the\nusual fashion.  The intraoperative transesophageal\nechocardiogram showed that his left ventricular function had\nan ejection fraction of 10% to 20%.  He had a dilated right\nventricular cavity with mild global right ventricular free\nwall hypokinesis.  He had mild mitral regurgitation and trace\naortic regurgitation.  There was no PFO.\n\nA median sternotomy was made.  The incision was extended a\ncouple centimeters below the xiphoid process.  The\npreperitoneal pocket was created and the pericardium was\nopened up.  The patient was fully heparinized prior to\ninserting the aortic cannula and a venous cannula into the\nright atrial appendage.  We went on bypass.  I elevated the\nleft ventricular apex and identified the dimpled portion.  I\ncored out the LV apex and anchored the apical sewing ring with\npledgeted ___ Ethibond sutures.  BioGlue was then sprayed around\nthe raw surface and around the suture line.  The pump was then\nattached to the apical sewing ring and tied down with a heavy\nsuture and fastened with a silastic strap for reinforcement.  \nThe\noutflow graft was then connected up to the pump.  A side-biting\nclamp was placed on the proximal ascending aorta and the graft\nwas measured and cut appropriately at a beveled angle.\nLongitudinal aortotomy was made and the outflow graft was\nthen sewn to the aorta with running ___ Prolene sutures.  A\nde-airing needle was placed into the graft.  The drive line,\nwhich had been brought out through the left side of the \nabdominal wall, was then connected up to the controller.  We\nstarted at 6000 rpm.  The patient was ventilated.  The\nside-biting clamp was released.  As we came down on the\ncardiopulmonary bypass machine, we went up on the rpm of the\npump.  There was minimal air seen on the echocardiogram. The\napical ring was in good position. With the assistance from \nthe echocardiogram, we adjusted the rpm until the left\nventricular cavity was adequately decompressed.  The\nintraventricular septum was midline.  The right ventricular\ndysfunction was mild with some inotropic support.  Protamine\nwas given to reverse heparin.  The cannulas were removed.\nThree chest tubes were inserted, one in the left apical/left\npleural space and two in the anterior mediastinum.  A piece of\nGortex tube graft was used to cover the outflow graft. The\npericardium was reapproximated around the aorta and the right\nventricle and the remaining opening was covered with\nCorMatrix.  The sternum was closed with stainless steel\nwires.  The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous tissues were\nclosed in 2 layers with running Vicryl sutures.  The skin was\nclosed with running subcuticular Monocryl sutures.  Prevena\nwas placed over the incision.  The patient left the\noperating room, intubated and in stable condition, on\ninotropes and pressors.\n\n___ LEFT CHEST TUBE INSERTION\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:  None.\n\nINDICATIONS:  This is a ___ male who underwent\nplacement of an LVAD on ___.  Postoperatively, he\ndeveloped a large left pleural effusion.  I recommended\ndraining his effusion and discussed the risks and benefits of\na chest tube insertion with the patient.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Patient was placed in a slight\nright lateral decubitus position.  His left chest was prepped\nwith chlorhexidine and draped in the usual fashion.  1%\nlidocaine was used to infiltrate the subcutaneous tissues, as\nwell as the intercostal area.  An incision was made.\nDissection was carried down into the chest wall.  I entered\nthe interspace and inserted a ___ angled chest tube,\nangled posteriorly.  The fluid that we got back was\nserosanguineous in nature.  A total of 1090 cc of fluid was\ndrained.  The chest tube was anchored down with silk sutures\nand a dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the\nprocedure.\n\n==========================\nMICRO\n==========================\n\n___ blood cultures:  No growth.\n\n___ and ___ CATH TIP: NO GROWTH \n\n___ - ___, multiple sets of blood cultures all \nnegative/NGTD. \n\n___ and ___ STOOL: Negative for toxigenic C. difficile \nby the Illumigene DNA amplification assay.

He presented for follow-up on ___ and labs \nwere sent which showed increase in creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6. \nPatient denies dyspnea, dyspnea on exertion, or decreased \nexercise tolerance. No crackles, and no peripheral edema, \nhowever JVP elevated to 12cm. Weight is up from 155kg in ___ \nto 165kg. The patient was diuresed with 80mg IV furosemide with \nimprovement. He was continued on home valsartan and milrinone.\n\n===================\nPRE LVAD CCU COURSE\n===================\n\nHe was transferred to the CCU on ___ for swan measurement to \ntitrate medications in preparation for LVAD placement.  In the \nCCU, a Swan Ganz catheter was placed on ___. Once the Swan was \nin place, his PICC was removed and fluid from the tip was sent \nfor culture, due to concerns that he may have had some puruluent \ndrainage from the insertion site. This showed no growth. He was \ndiuresed with Lasix 80mg IV as appropriate and his \nSpironolactone was increased to 50mg daily. His Metoprolol was \ndiscontinued.  In preparation for surgery, his Swan was removed \non ___, and his Valsartan was held after the evening dose on \n___ due to concerns for vasoplegia intraoperatively. In place \nof the Valsartan, he was started on Isordil and Hydralazine for \nafterload reduction. His spironolactone was stopped on ___, \nafter his creatinine was noted to increase from 1.2 to 1.9. He \nhad been diuresed -700cc the day prior. He also had his \npacemaker interrogated by EP on ___, the settings were changed \nfrom VVIR to Ventricular Tachy Mode.\n\n====================\nPOST LVAD CCU COURSE\n====================\n\nOn ___, he went to the OR for LVAD Heartmate 2 placement (not a \ntransplant candidate to do high BMI).  Overall the patient \ntolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was \ntransferred to the CVICU on Epi/milrinone/valetri/Vasopressin. \nHe was initially coagulopathic, received platelets and PRBC. Had \nbloody OGT drainage which was irrigated,  and he was switched to \nprotonix. He developed hyperkalemic but responded to insulin and \nLasix.  Bleeding continued for few days requiring frequent \ntransfusion. Source not identified. Heparin was held for period \nthen restarted once hct stabilized.  POD 1 found the patient \nextubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably with \nCPAP and valetri continued.   The patient was neurologically \nintact and slow weaned off pressors and epi. He was started on \nsildenafil. Milrinone was slowly weaned down. There was concern \nthat outflow graft was causing  RV compression. TEE unable to be \ndone due to inability to  lay flat and worsening SOB. He \ntherefore underwent CTA which showed large left hemothorax. CT \nwas placed by Dr. ___ 1200cc serosanguinous drainage. He \ndeveloped SVT/rapid afib. Started on amiodarone and digoxin. He \ncontinue to have poor rate control and was successfully \ncardioverted to SR 110 on POD#7. He continue to make progress \ndespite the concern of RV compression and tolerated slow \nmilrinone wean.

        "prediction": "I'll provide an analysis of the patient's case and offer some potential insights.\n\n**Case Analysis:**\n\nThe patient underwent surgery for a right Middle Cavernous Artery (MCA) aneurysm, which is located close to the brain. The surgery was likely performed endovascularly or via craniotomy, depending on the size and location of the aneurysm. The procedure was successful, and the patient was discharged home in stable condition.\n\n**Post-Operative Complications:**\n\nThe patient experienced some post-operative complications, including:\n\n1. Headache and nausea (resolved with pain management)\n2. Incisional pain (well-controlled with medication)\n3. Right facial swelling\n4. Constipation (prevented with dietary changes and laxatives)\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n\nAlthough the patient's condition was stable at discharge, there are some potential concerns that should be monitored:\n\n1. **Muffled hearing:** The patient may experience muffled hearing in the ear near the incision area due to swelling or pressure on the facial nerve.\n2. **Numbness or tingling:** The patient may experience numbness or tingling in the area of the incision, which can take weeks or months to fully resolve.\n3. **Low back pain:** The patient may experience low back pain or shooting pain down the leg, which can be a sign of nerve compression or irritation.\n\n**Discharge Instructions:**\n\nThe discharge instructions provided are comprehensive and cover essential post-operative care. However, some additional information could have been included:\n\n1. **Pain management:** While pain is well-controlled with medication, patients should be advised to contact their surgeon's office if they experience increased pain or discomfort.\n2. **Incision care:** The instructions emphasize the importance of keeping the wound clean and dry, but further guidance on wound dressing and follow-up appointments could have been provided.\n3. **Emotional support:** The patient may benefit from emotional support and counseling to address potential depression or anxiety related to their surgery.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nBased on the patient's case, I would recommend:\n\n1. Regular follow-up appointments with the surgeon to monitor for any post-operative complications or concerns.\n2. Continued pain management with medication as needed.\n3. Encouragement of physical therapy to ensure proper range of motion and prevent atrophy in the affected area.\n4. Emotional support and counseling to address potential depression or anxiety.\n\nOverall, the patient's recovery appears to be on track, but close monitoring and follow-up care will help ensure a smooth transition back to normal activities.",

These findings are compatible with \ncolitis. Cold forcep biopsies were performed for histology at \nthe descending.  \n\nProtruding Lesions A single sessile 4 mm polyp of benign \nappearance was found in the sigmoid. This was not removed in the \nsetting of recent GI bleeding. Small grade 1 internal \nhemorrhoids were noted.  \n\nExcavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen in the sigmoid. \nDiverticulosis appeared to be of mild severity.  \n \nImpression: Polyp in the sigmoid.
